# [ FIREFOX USERCHROME.CSS ]

These are Firefox usercChrome.css that I have created. They are meant to be minimal & with the colors being based on the ever popular [**arc theme.**](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme)

## Arc..

#### Close buttons are hidden inside favicons.

#### New Tab background color changed with the css posted at the bottom of the page.

#### Tabs are hidden if there is only one tab open.

#### Changing the background color of new tabs.

Just add the code below to your userContent.css file. It's that simple.

```css
/* Newtab */
@-moz-document url("about:blank") {
    body {
        background-color: #272b35 !important;
    }
}
```

> Firefox arc was originally converted from my old [**Waterfox userchrome.css.**](https://github.com/furycd001/dots/tree/master/waterfox) I wanted to still keep everything minimal, but have it be more useable. As always there's still a few things that need worked on, but it really is pretty complete as it is now & I'm super happy using it daily.

## Webview..

> This is a super minimal userchrome that has everything except the webview hidden. You can access the urlbar by pressing **CTRL+L** & switch between tabs using **CTRL+PGUP & CTRL+PGDN**.

## Single..

> Everything you should need is squished onto a single row. This is totally usable until you randomly decide to open like a gazillion tabs.
