# [ FIREFOX USERCHROME.CSS ]


This is my Firefox userchrome.css. It's based on the ever popular [**arc theme**](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) & converted from my old [**Waterfox userchrome.css**](https://github.com/furycd001/dots/tree/master/waterfox). I wanted to still keep minimal looks in mind, but be more useable. As always there's still a few things that need worked on, but it really is pretty complete as it is now & I'm super happy using it daily.
