Here you'll find a collection of scripts that I use.

+ **atom** >> Resizes & moves atom whenever I open a specific file....
+ **batteryfull** >> Displays a notification whenever my batter is fully charged....
+ **colors** >> Displays colors inside a terminal window & is mainly used for [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) posts....
+ **conkybattery** >> This can be used to display battery percentage in conky if conkys built in commands do not work....
+ **conkypanel** >> Used to pipe conky from console to txt file in /tmp/. I use this along with [**awk**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/awk) & [**xfce4-genmon-plugin.**](https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin) to display conky in xfce4-panel....
+ **fetch** >> A simple fetch script that I started working on but never finished....
+ **todo** >> Set to run on startup and displays the contents of todo.txt in a notification....
+ **xres** >> This is used for Xresources when I'm on one of my minimal install laptops....
