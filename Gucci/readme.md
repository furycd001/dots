# [ SCRIPTS ]

Here you'll find a collection of scripts that I use in my setup.

+ **battery** >> Displays a notification whenever battery is fully charged & opens a window created with yad whenever the battery is low....
+ **clam** >> Anti Virus that scans system from the terminal....
+ **colors** >> Displays colors inside a terminal window & is mainly used for [**r/unixporn**](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) posts....
+ **conkybattery** >> This can be used to display battery percentage in conky if conkys built in commands do not work....
+ **conkypanel** >> Used to pipe conky from console to txt file in /tmp/. I use this along with [**awk**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/awk) & [**xfce4-genmon-plugin.**](https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin) to display conky in xfce4-panel....
