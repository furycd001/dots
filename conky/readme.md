# [ CONKY CONFIG ]

My conky config is usually very simple / minimal. I also don't it very often, but when I do you'll find it here....

## Single line pipe..

This is a single line that is set to output to console. The output is then piped to a txt file in /tmp/ which is then displayed in xfce4-panel using [**awk**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/awk) & [**xfce4-genmon-plugin.**](https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin) The screenshot below shows my full desktop, but zoom in on the panel to get a closer look at my conky config. The script that I use during startup to pipe conky to a txt file can be found in my scripts folder labeled "conkypanel"....
