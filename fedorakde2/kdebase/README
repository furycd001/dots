What it is
----------

kdebase is the second mandatory package (besides kdelibs) for the KDE Kool
Desktop Environment. Here we have various applications and infrastructure
files and libraries. Here is an overview of the directories:

* applnk: files to create the icons for the K menu button
* bsd-port: needed to create a BSD package
* debian: needed to create a debian package
* doc: XML formatted documentation files for the apps
* drkonqi: if ever an app crashes (heaven forbid!) then Dr.Konqi will be so
kind and make a stack trace. This is a great help for the developers to fix
the bug.
* kaddressbook: an addressbook (for postal addresses, phone numbers and of course
for e-mail addresses)
* kappfinder: searches your hard disk for non-KDE applications, e.g. Acrobat
Reader (tm) and installs those apps under the K start button
* kate: a fast and advanced text editor with nice plugins
* kcheckpass: small program to enter and check passwords, only to be used by
other programs
* kcontrol: the KDE Control Center allows you to tweak the KDE settings
* kdcop: GUI app to browse for DCOP interfaces, can also execute them
* kdebugdialog: allows you to specify which debug messages you want to see
* kdeprint: the KDE printing system
* kdesktop: you guessed it: the desktop above the panel
* kdesu: a graphical front end to "su"
* kdm: replacement for XDM, for those people that like graphical logins
* khelpcenter: the app to read all great documentation about KDE
* khotkeys: intercepts keys and can call applications
* kicker: the panel at the botton with the K start button and the taskbar etc
* kioslave: infrastructure that helps make every KDE application internet
enabled, e.g. to directly save a file to ftp://place.org/dir/file.txt
* klipper: enhances and extenses the X clipboard
* kmenuedit: edit for the menu below the K start button
* konqueror: the file manager and web browser you get easily used to
* konsole: a shell program similar to xterm
* kpager: applet to show the contents of the virtual desktops
* kpersonalizer: the customization wizard you get when you first start KDE
* kreadconfig: a tool for shell scripts to get info from KDE's config files
* kscreensaver: the KDE screensaver environment and lot's of savers
* ksmserver: the KDE session manager (saves program status on login, restarts
those program at the next login)
* ksplash: the screen displayed while KDE starts
* kstart: to launch applications with special window properties
such as iconified etc
* ksysguard: task manager and system monitor, even for remote systems
* ktip: gives you tips how to use KDE
* kwin: the KDE window manager
* kxkb: a keyboard map tool
* kxmlrpc: allows clients to control DCOP-enabled KDE applications
throught XML
* l10n: mostly country flags
* legacyimport: odd name for a cute program to load GTK themes
* libkonq: some libraries needed by Konqueror
* nsplugins: together with OSF/Motif or Lesstif allows you to use Netscape (tm)
plugins in Konqueror
* pics: various icons and wallpapers

Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file.

If XPM support wasn't configured, it may be that configure has no idea
where your XPM libraries are.  If so, set XPM_INCLUDE and XPM_LDFLAGS to
the paths where configure should look for XPM.  But if you haven't
installed XPM or it didn't come with your system, that's no problem.  You
will only miss a few screensavers.  The same thing applies with OPENGL
support.  Here you have to set GL_INCLUDE and GL_LDFLAGS.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at ftp://ftp.trolltech.com
and download the latest Qt 2.x release.

Be advised, if you're using FreeBSD, then please do not use the Qt port
that comes along with it. 

Configuring
-----------

kdebase's configure script supports all the standard GNU autoconf options
(you can have the various options listed for you by specifying the --help
switch), plus the following options are also supported.  Note:  the *non*
default variation is listed, so if you see --enable-debug, the default is
--disable debug.

`--x-includes=DIR'
     use X include files in DIR

`--x-libraries=DIR'
     use X library files in DIR

`--enable-debug'
     creates debugging code [default=no]

`--enable-strict'
     Add strict[er] compiler options (may not work!) to the CFLAGS and
     CXXFLAGS.  This is GNU CC specific for the time being.

`--with-gnu-ld'
     assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]

`--disable-libtool-lock'
     force libtool not to do file locking

`--disable-nls'
     do not use Native Language Support (i18n)

`--with-qt-dir'
     where the root of qt is installed 

`--with-qt-includes=DIR'
     look for the Qt header files in DIR

`--with-qt-libraries=DIR'
     look for the Qt library in DIR

`--with-extra-includes=DIR'
     look for include files in DIR in addition to any other
     `standard' paths

`--with-extra-libs=DIR'
     look for [extra] libraries in DIR too

`--disable-path-check'
     don't try to make sure that kdebase is installed into the same
     base KDE directory as the rest of KDE
 
`--with-install-root=DIR'
     the root to install to [default=/] (i.e. make / == DIR, so /usr
     becomes DIR/usr)

`--disable-rpath'
     do not use the rpath feature of ld

`--with-xdmdir=DIR'
     use xdm (and config files) from DIR if the xdm config dir can't be
     found automaticly

`--with-pam[=ARG]'
     enable support for PAM: ARG=[yes|no|service name]

`--with-shadow'
     if you want to check for and use shadow password support if it's present

`--without-gl'
     disable any software which depends on OpenGL

`--without-xpm'
     disable color pixmap XPM tests

`--with-xinerama'
     enable Xinerama support

Please check ./configure --help for a more current list of options and what they
do. 

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs. If you experience problems and want
to report problems to the KDE Bugs database, it is recommended to recompile
with this switch enabled to make the backtraces more verbose (and thus
giving the developer more information about the cause of the bug).

Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely, and is depreciated.
On a system where KDEDIR is specific to KDE (i.e. not /usr), rm -rf $KDEDIR
does it as well.

More Info
---------

If your system does not have XPM installed, and you cannot locate a
package of it, you may obtain it from ftp://avahi.inria.fr/pub/xpm, or you
may find it in ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles

If you are running a FreeBSD system, you will need to make sure that LIBS
is set to "-Wl,-export-dynamic".  The easiest way to do this is to prefix
configure with it, i.e.: LIBS="-Wl,-export-dynamic" ./configure.  Thanks
to Will Andrews <will@FreeBSD.org> and Arun Sharma <adsharma@sharmas.dhs.org>
for identifying what needed to be done, and how to do it, and such.

If your system supports PAM (Plugable Authentication Modules), please see
the README.pam file in this directory for more information about using KDE
with PAM.

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you would like to find
out more about a specific application included in kdebase.

More FAQs on http://www.kde.org/info/faq.html

If you have problems compiling and installing this package, please 
check the kde-devel@kde.org mailing list archive (see http://lists.kde.org)
to see if somebody had a similiar problem already. If not, try posting
a message to the list with detailed information about the compile problem. 

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
