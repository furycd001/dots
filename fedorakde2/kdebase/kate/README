                *** Kate version 0.2.1 ***
Kate is a fast texteditor for the KDE destop with an Emacs-style document interface.
I hope it works well and improve workspeed on many little
textfiles. ;-)
Out new buffer managment will allow it to open 50MB files ++ in less than 5 seconds
(at least on my 400Mhz P2 ;)
