The KCheckPass authentication software:
-----------------------------------------

KCheckPass is KDE's authentication program. It is meant to be
used by any software in need of user authentication, most
notably login programs (kdm) and screensavers.

It enhances security be the following means:

- It's only a small program, which is hopefully simple enough to
  allow it to be SUID root. Setting it to SUID root is necessary
  on Shadow Password systems.
- No other program in need of user authentication, must be
  SUID root.
- It provides a single implementation to check passwords. So one
  only must take a closer look at KCheckPass to ensure password
  security. It's much easier for programs using KCheckPass to
  preserve security.


Technique:
----------
KCheckPass is a simple password checker. Just invoke and
send it the password on stdin.

If the password was accepted, the program exits with 0;
if it was rejected, it exits with 1. Any other exit
code signals an error.



Compilation hints:
------------------
Compile with -DHAVE_VSYSLOG if you have vsyslog().
Compile with -DHAVE_PAM if you have a PAM system, and link with -lpam -ldl
  (If libdl is present).
Compile with -DHAVE_SHADOW if you have a shadow password system.
