This is the README for the display setup modules.

7 December 1999: Geert Jansen

  Finished porting to kcontrol2. Some modules still need some work because
  the underlying programs changed (style).

30 October 1999:

  I rewrote the background setup tab so that it makes use of
  the new background code.

  Some features/issues:
  * Support for background programs (a la xearth)
  * Possibility to export the desktop background as a shared pixmap. This
    allows clients to implement pseudo transparency very easy.
  * Support for drop-in patterns and background programs.
  * Works very much like the old setup, but uses a different config file.
  * Uses KBackgroundRenderer to render so no code duplication.


  That's it.

**** Original README ****

Some new features :

1. One Desktop radio button -
   some people want only one wallpaper for all desktop
   - however, also this one desktop can be set to randomize

2. Random radio button - whether to use one wallpaper for a desktop or 
   randomly choose from the list.

3. Setup push button - opens dialog for setup of randomizing
   - you can specify timer interval in miliseconds
   - use drag and drop to create list of items
   - you can create any kind of items, they do not have to contain wallpaper
     f.e create two color background with a pattern
   - use Add button for adding item with "No wallpaper"
   - use Delete button to delete items
   - in-order radio button - whether you want kbgndwm to choose files in order
                             or randomly
   - for each desktop you may specify list of items ( using drag and drop )
     and timer interval.
   - kbgndwm will at given interval change wallpapers on desktops.

4. Docking radio button - kbgndwm can dock into kpanel. If you click on dock
   window and random mode is set, then kbgndwm will change wallpaper without
   waiting on timer
   - clicking with right button opens popup menu with two items :
      "Background Settings" will start "kcmdisplay background"
      "One Desktop" toggles one desktop mode
      
5. More modes : Mirrored, Symmetrical Mirrored, Symmetrical Tiled,
		Center Tiled, Centered Brick, Centered Warp, Centered Maxpect

6. Use drag and drop from kfm on the monitor widget in settings dialog to
   quickly change wallpaper in the monitor

7. Use drag and drop from kfm on the docked widget to change wallpaper

8. Images larger than desktop are automatically scaled.
