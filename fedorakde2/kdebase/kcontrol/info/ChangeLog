	* info_fbsd.cpp: Fix the SCSI information, so that it's actually 
	displayed (only if info can be found).  However, either kcminfo or
	camcontrol needs to be suid root. Your choice.

	* info_fbsd.cpp: Add a few (hopefully) useful comments, and tidy up
	some of the code.

1998-12-08  Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>

	* info.cpp:
	fixed the column-width of KTabListboxes, where only one column was/is visible.
	If more than one column is used, then the called function should set the width !

	* added sections to the online-help in the /doc-directory

1998-12-08  Duncan Haldane <f.d.m.haldane@cwix.com>

	* info_linux.cpp: 
	made the sound info look first for /dev/sndstat, before /proc/sound.  
	Introduced #defines for all the hard-coded /proc/* files to make subsequent 
	changes easier.

	* expanded the descriptions in the online help.

	* deleted processor.xpm and memory.xpm (no longer needed)
