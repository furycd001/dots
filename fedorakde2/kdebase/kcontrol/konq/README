This module contains a combination of configuration items which at first
sight seem to be a rather weird combination.

It contains configuration for:
* KDesktop
* Konqueror 
* Number of virtual desktops. (Handled by KWin via NETWM)
* Behaviour of desktop borders (Handled by KWin)

The reason for this combination is that the configuration of KDesktop and 
Konqueror is very similair codewise. On the other hand, the number of virtual
desktops, border behaviour and the other KDesktop options belongs together 
from a user interface point of view. The result is that all these options 
are now grouped together here.

In total it provide 3 configuration modules:
* desktop.desktop (Desktop configuration)
* kcmkonq.desk (File browser configuration)
* virtualdesks.desktop (Configuration of virtual desktops)

virtualdesktops.desktop is used by the panel and isn't shown in the control 
center. The settings in this module are also part of desktop.desktop.
