1999-01-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (V0.7.3)

	generated.

	fore- & background to colors section.

	* Added groups for gimmick and window button layout.

	* Improved icon quality.

	* Added logging of installed files plus backup copies.
	Now it should never happen that previously installed files
	are deleted by mistake (happend with sounds before).

	* Panel background is now rotated 90 degrees counter
	clockwise if panel is right or left. In fact this should
	be done by kpanel itself ;-)
