MGBreizh Theme

1. What you need to make this theme working

- KDE (hehehehe, really??? :o)
- Sound support

*********************************************************************************

2. If you don't have any sound card

Don't install the sound directory and the kwmsoundrc file.

*********************************************************************************

3. You have a Sound Blaster but don't know how to install it

That's really easy to do, follow this steps :

3a. Type : pnpdump > pnpstuff
this will install a file(pnpstuff) into your home directory which has
all your PnP settings

3b. read carefully the pnpstuff file ($HOME/pnpstuff)
You'll have to choose the right settings for your card(s)

Mine looks like this :

# (DEBUG)
(READPORT 0x0203)
(ISOLATE)
(IDENTIFY *)

(CONFIGURE CTL009d/78102668 (LD 0
(INT 0 (IRQ 5 (MODE +E)))
(DMA 0 (CHANNEL 1))
(DMA 1 (CHANNEL 5))
(IO 0 (BASE 0x0220))
(IO 1 (BASE 0x0330))
(IO 2 (BASE 0x0388))
(ACT Y)
))

(CONFIGURE CTL009d/78102668 (LD 1
(IO 0 (BASE 0x0200))
(ACT Y)
))

You got it ?
3c. now save this file as isapnp.conf and put it in the /etc/ directory

to check is isapnp.conf is working type :
isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf

if there's errors, correct them.

3d. Now, type :
sndconfig --noprobe

choose your SB card, and OK.

then it'll ask you for the IO PORT, if you refer to your isapnp.conf you should see something like (IO 0(BASEx0220)), ok ?
well that's the IO PORT, so choose 0x220. If this is a different port, choose another one.
Do the same thing for the IRQ and the DMAs.

After you've settled this and pressed OK, you should hear a sound like "blahblahblah Linux", if you hear this that's perfect !
now you're done with the sound card !

4. The images

goto ~/MGBreizh/images/
type mv *.xpm $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kwm/pics

*************************************************************************************
5. Other images

goto ~/MGBreizh/
type mv panel.xpm $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kpanel/pics/
then mv kdegear.xpm $KDEDIR/share/wallpapers/

*************************************************************************************

6. The sounds

goto ~/MGBreizh/sounds/
to check if you have the sound directory type :
ls -l $KDEDIR/share/
if not, type mkdir $KDEDIR/share/sounds
then type mv *.wav $KDEDIR/share/sounds/

*************************************************************************************
7. Configuration files
goto ~/MGBreizh/

7a. MGBreizh.kcsrc
type mv MGBreizh.kcsrc $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kdisplay/color-schemes/

7b. kwmrc, kwmsoundrc, kpanelrc
type mv *rc* $HOME/.kde/share/config/

*************************************************************************************

8. Restarting KDE
Ok, like the sounds won't be loaded with a simple "restart", just logout
and restart X.

Enjoy !
