This is a browser/executor for DCOP. It queries the DCOP clients in a system, their interfaces,
and the interfaces' arguments. You can even execute DCOP calls by double-clicking on a 
call. If the method has parameters, kdcop will open a dialog and prompt you for them. If the method
returns a return value, you will see it in a message box after the call.

This little tool fairly much does what I wanted it to do, but let me know if you want more features.
