kdebugdialog
------------

In --fullmode, you can choose to dump debug output to a file.
But keep in mind that multiple programs may be writing to that
area (and therefore to that file), so they will always be appending
to it and never clearing it. So don't forget to empty it once in a
while!

Your configuration will of course be stored in
  $HOME/.kde/share/config/kdebugrc
