	* The source directory structure changed entirely
	* External greeter: kdm_greet
	  - libKdmGreet.so is gone
	* External config parser is now named kdm_config
	* The config files are all located in ${kde_confdir}/kdm now;
	  KDM will no longer use kdm-config

2001-04-02  Simon Hausmann <simon@kde.org>

        * patch by Joachim Plack <jack@caldera.de> to make dead keys work when
          the keyboard is grabbed.

2001-03-19  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* External config parser: kdm_getcfg
	  - kdm will now use kdm-config, NOT xdm-config
	* Stolen idea for console mode handling from dtlogin
	* Tons of internal changes

2000-12-07  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* New XDM port from xfree86 4.0.1
	* Made the greeter dynamically loadable
	* Moved chooser and greeter to separate directories, 
	  same for unused stuff (misc/)
	* Optional auto-login, auto-re-login and password-free login
	* A LOT of bug fixes and clean up

1999-11-09  Harald Hoyer <Harald.Hoyer@RedHat.de>

	* made kchooser

1999-07-02  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* Fixes from KDE_1_1_BRANCH:
        1) The "session type" wasn't updated when the user left the login line
        edit with Tab (Pressing return worked fine). This is fixed now.
        2) Kdm accepts NOBROADCAST in the Xaccess file now.
        3) PAM modules now have the ability to set environment variables
        for the user. Without this patch, changes to the env. are lost.

1999-06-07  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <hoelzer@kde.org>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp:

	  added Lilo reboot handling from 
          Stefan van den Oord <oord@cs.utwente.nl> 
	
	  added button to switch to console mode

	  TODO: Update kcmkdm to actually use these options


1999-02-01  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp :
	fork()/sleep() to prevent gpm and X from racing.

1998-12-17  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp :
	Changed char[] to QString. We want unicode ;)

1998-12-16 Duncan Haldane <f.d.m.haldane@cwix.com>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp : 
	(1) made the PAM service name configurable
	if KDE_PAM_SERVICE is defined (if not, it is "xdm"). (This
	should have been done when I did this to verify.c a while
	back).
	
	(2) Added a extra line to the shutdown dialog box
	"(Enter Root password") if it is in "RootOnly" mode.

	(3) Changed the confusing description of the "exit xdm" button
	to "Restart X server", which is the actual function of the
	third button.


1998-12-04  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* genauth.c (len;): Read random data from "randomFile" (usually
		/dev/mem) for auth key.

	* kgreeter.cpp (GreetUser): Removed hardcoded backspace

1998-11-27  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* Make the authentication cookie more unpredictable by adding
	times from X events to seed
