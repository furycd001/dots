This is the KDE Display Manager (kdm) v0.92 for KDE 2.2, 
the KDE replacement for the X Display Manager (xdm).


How to setup kdm
----------------

KDM's config files are all located in ${kde_confdir}/kdm.
"make install" will install an example configuration if the directory
does not exist yet.

You can change the configuration from the KDE Control Center. 
You will find the Login Manager module in "System" -> "Login Manager".

Have a look at README.pam in the kdebase top level directory if your
system uses PAM.


Running KDM from init
---------------------

NOTE, that this description applies to RedHat and must be adapted for
other distributions/systems.

   Edit (as root) /etc/inittab.

   Look for the line: 

       x:5:respawn:/usr/X11/bin/xdm -nodaemon

   Replace it with:

       x:5:respawn:/opt/kde/bin/kdm -nodaemon

   This tells init(8) to respawn KDM, the KDE display manager, when
   the system is in run level 5. 

   To start KDM, either run (as root) /sbin/telinit 5 (to switch to
   run level 5), or (this is risky! don't do it until you _know_ you
   want the system to boot into this every time!) edit /etc/inittab
   and change the line:

       id:3:initdefault:

   to

       id:5:initdefault:

   If you do the latter step, then every time your system boots 
   successfully it will go into run level 5 and run KDM, 
   presenting you the exceedingly cute KDE login screen.

"It doesn't work!!"
-------------------

More input! ;-)

KDM accepts two command line options related to logging. These options
_must_ come first on the command line, if they are used:

  -debug <n>
    <n> is a decimal or hexadecimal (prefix 0x) number.
    The number is a bitfield, i.e., it is formed by summing up the 
    required values from this table:
    1 (0x1) - core debugging. probably the most useful one.
    2 (0x2) - config reader debugging.
    4 (0x4) - greeter debugging.
    8 (0x8) - ipc debugging. this logs _all_ communication between the
	      core, the config reader and the greeter - including the
	      passwords you type - so edit the log before showing it to
	      somebody.
    16 (0x10) - wait after forking session sub-daemon.
    32 (0x20) - wait after starting config reader.
    64 (0x40) - wait after starting greeter.
	the wait options are only useful, if you need to attach a debugger
	to a process but it crashes before you are able to do so without
	the delay.
    256 (0x100) - core Xauth debugging.
    512 (0x200) - don't fork session sub-daemon, but manage one session
	in the master daemon. not for real-world use.

  -logfile <file>
    <file> is the file to log various messages to.
    For internal reasons there is no option in kdmrc to permanently specify 
    another log file location. If you redirect KDM's standard error output
    to a file, KDM will log there.
    If KDM is configured to use syslog, all internally generated messages 
    are logged to the "daemon" facility. The log usually can be found in 
    /var/log/debug.log and /var/log/daemon.log; make sure, that daemon.* 
    is logged (look at /etc/syslog.conf). 

Send me the logs together with a detailed description what you did and
what happended. If your problem is related to a specific configuration,
you should also attach a tar.gz archive of your kdm config directory.
