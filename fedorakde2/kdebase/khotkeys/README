KHotKeys :

 This is a very simple version of KHotKeys ported to KDE2.
 It will be replaced by a complete version after KDE2.0 final is out.
 This version is configured via KMenuEdit.
 Edit $KDEHOME/share/config/khotkeysrc if you want to run other things
 than K Menu entries.
 If any serious bug appears, simply removing kdebase/khotkeys should
 be enough to "fix" this - KMenuEdit won't find KHotKeys and won't use it.
