KasBar TNG Design
=================

In order to support both the various features people asked for when I
discussed Kasbar on dot.kde.org without ending up with a completely
unmaintainable application, I've decided to rewrite the code. It's a
fairly small application, so this isn't a big deal. The task management
side of things (interacting with the window manager etc.) is now handled
via the standard TaskManager API provided by kicker.

The division of labour between the classes is like this:

* KasBar, KasItem, KasPopup

  These classes implement the KasBar widget. KasBar provides the
  layout and smart redraws while the KasItem class is an abstract
  interface for the items forming the bars contents. The KasPopup
  class provides a self positioning widget that should be subclassed
  to provide useful information.

  These classes are usable standalone.

* KasTasker, KasTaskItem, KasTaskPopup

  These classes provide the glue linking the task management and
  karbar modules together.

* KasGroupItem, KasGroupPopup

  These class provide a container item for a group of tasks, and popup
  window that shows them in a KasTasker widget.

* KasBarExtension

  This class handles integration with kicker and configuration info.

* KasPrefsDlg

  This is the configuration dialog. It acts directly on the kastasker
  widget to provide immediate feedback of the effects of configuration
  changes. Any changes being previewed are reverted if the user cancels
  the dialog because the configuration is reloaded.
