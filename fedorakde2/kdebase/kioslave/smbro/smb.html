The smb ioslave enables you to browse the 
shares of a windows (or samba) network. It is a wrapper
around the command line tool smbclient, which is part of the samba
distribution. You need to have samba installed to use this ioslave.
Since it uses the smbclient tool, this ioslave supports everything
what your installed samba supports. To be able to authenticate
to Windows NT Domain Controllers you need at least Samba 2.0. To be able
to access the shares of Windows 2000 machines, you need at least Samba 2.0.7.
Currently the ioslave is <i>read-only</i>, i.e. you are not able
to write to remote shares. The current smb ioslave  also doesn't 
provide a list of running hosts, you should use the <i>lan</i> or <i>rlan</i>
ioslave to get a network neighbourhood.
<br>
To see the shares of a host, enter <code> smb://the_host</code>, to access
a share directly enter <code>smb://the_host/the_share</code>.<br>
<br>
You can set your default user name and password in the KDE Control Center in
Network/Windows Shares. This is especially useful if you are a member
of a Windows NT domain. There you can also set your workgroup name, this is 
in most cases not required.
<br>
This ioslave is tested and developed mainly using samba 2.0.7, but other versions
of samba should work too.<br>
