2001-05-10  Mark Deneen <deneen@bucknell.edu>

	* Implemented header of vertical toggle views, with support for
	a caption text and a close-button

2001-05-05  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Set WDestructiveClose again when going
	to fullscreen mode (Qt bug), to prevent Alt+F4 from crashing.
	* konq_misc.cc: Only abort full-screen mode for windows on the
	current desktop.

2001-05-01  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc : moved the connect and disconnect calls
	to/from the highlighting signals of the actioncollections into
	two separate methods, for cleanup, and use the qt child deletion
	mechanism to delete the bookmark actioncollection

2001-04-28  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_actions.h (class KonqGoURLAction): new class, derived
	from KAction, used for the 'go url' action. when plugging the
	action into a toolbar make sure to align the button right.
	Otherwise the toolbar layout completely fucks up and QToolBar
	starts flickering like mad, when the window width is getting
	small than the lenght of the url in the combobox.
	
	* konq_mainwindow.cc (initActions): use KonqGoURLAction

2001-04-27  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (goURL): new slot, sending a fake key
	event to the lineedit, acting like the user pressing return
	(initActions): allocate a "Go" action and connect it to the
	new goURL slot

	* konqueror.rc: inserted go action into the locationbar

2001-04-07  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (slotReload): call m_currentView->lockHistory(),
	to fix #23818
	* konq_view.cc/h (reload): removed obsolete method

2001-03-31  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc(slotRunFinished): Stop wheel animation when a 
	konqrun fails and we have no view.

2001-03-25  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* iconview/konq_iconview.cc (KonqKfmIconView): specify a status text for
	some actions. Likewise for some actions in KonqDirPart. Also call
	setHighlightingEnabled in the KonqDirPart constructor

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (slotShowMenuBar): call saveMainWindowSettings and
	KGlobal::config()->sync() after toggling the visiblity of the menubar,
	just like it is done for toolbars.
	(slotPartActivated): connect and disconnect to/from the actionStatusText
	and clearStatusText signals of the part's actioncollection

2001-03-02  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_view.cc, konq_browseriface.cc/h: Utilize and implement the newly
	  added KParts::BrowserInterface

2001-02-06  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>
	
	* konq_mainwindow.cc (openBookmarkURL): Patch by 
	Marco Krohn <Marco.Krohn@stud.uni-hannover.de> to call openFilteredURL
	instead of openURL. Allows environment variables in bookmarks and
	other sugar.

2001-01-28  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (initActions): Plug the actions into a KAccel to
	fix short cuts in full screen mode

2001-01-16  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_actions.cc (fillHistoryPopup),
	  libkonq/kbookmarkmenu.cc (fillBookmarkMenu): When a Website has
	"&" in the Title, make sure to transform it into "&&" before
	inserting it into a QPopupMenu (for history or for bookmarks) , to
	avoid QPopupMenu interpreting it as accelerator.


2001-01-15  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_aboutpage.cc, konq_mainwindow.cc: Support for "about:konqueror".
	Credits to Simon for the part, and Torsten for the icons.

2001-01-14  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc (loadItem): Use openView instead of view->openURL,
	so that "view-follows-view" is also applied on startup. Fixes #17679.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc etc.: Lock to current location doesn't make the
	view passive anymore. This allows to e.g. change the view mode.

	* konq_frame.cc: Added Lock / Unlock to view statusbar's popupmenu.

2001-01-13  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_dirpart.cc etc.: Always paste to current directory, even
	when an item is selected.

2001-01-12  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc (loadViewProfile): Set active part before loading
	URL, so that the URL appears in the location bar.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc, konq_dirpart.cc: Store find part into history,
	in order to restore it when pressing back.

2001-01-11  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.*, konq_view.*: Store caption in the view,
	fixes caption when switching parts or removing one.

2001-01-11  Carsten Pfeiffer <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* konq_historymgr.*: KonqHistoryManager now implements the new 
	HistoryProvider (from KParts)

2001-01-09  Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.*, konq_dirpart.*: Copy (F7) and move (F8) are now
	available as soon as some files are selected in a directory view.
	A dialog asks for the destination.

2001-01-08  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* KonquerorIface.cc (openBrowserWindow),
	(createNewWindow),
	(createNewWindow), 
	(createBrowserWindowFromProfile),
	(createBrowserWindowFromProfile), 
	(createBrowserWindowFromProfileAndURL),
	(createBrowserWindowFromProfileAndURL): changed return type from void
	to DCOPRef

2001-01-07  David Faure <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.*: One KonqRun per view (del the old one in setRun),
	only one with no view associated (KonqMainWindow::m_initialKonqRun).
	This fixes "clicking on two bookmarks very fast opens both URLs,
	splitting the view".
	
2000-12-28  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc (loadViewProfile): When loading an empty profile
	(in particular the webbrowsing one) , activate the clear_location
	action. This gives the focus to the location bar -> the user can
	type in an url right away when loading the webbrowsing profile

2000-12-27  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (enableAllActions): for iterating over all actions
	don't use the action( int index ) method of KActionCollection but instead
	retrieve a QValueList<KAction *> and iterate over that, as the =+(int)
	operator of QDictIterator isn't really fast

	          ----- KDE 2.1 BETA 1 RELEASE ----
	
2000-12-12  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc: Fixed saving of profiles containing views
	"locked to their current location". The attribute was missing from 
	the profile.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Save and restore the preferred service in for 
	each toolbar 'viewmode' button.

2000-12-10  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc, konq_view.*, browserextension.*: Fixed
	the initial state of the common actions (cut,copy,paste etc.).
	Had to move all the handling of the action states to browserextension.

2000-12-10  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konqview_example.tar.gz: removed outdated example.

	* konq_frame.h, konq_view.{cc,h},
	  konq_factory.{cc,h}, konq_mainwindow.{cc,h} : Code cleanups,
	added missing const's here and there, removed some old unused
	code.

2000-12-09  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_actions.{cc,h}: Added KonqViewModeAction, a KRadioAction
	with an additional delayed popupmenu

	* konq_mainwindow.{cc,h}: Changed the toolbar viewmode buttons to
	show the available viewmodes grouped. For directories they are
	grouped by iconview and listview. This way one can quickly
	switch between the favourite list and iconview while still having
	the complete choice of viewmodes via delayed popupmenus
	(idea by Torsten and David)
	

2000-12-08  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (openURL): Support for about:blank
	Fix for severe problems with the activation of the standard actions.
	The state of the action is now stored in each KonqView.
	
2000-12-08  Malte Starostik <malte.starostik@t-online.de>
	
	* libkonq/, iconview/: Preview for HTML files implemented.

2000-12-08  David Faure  <faure@kde.org> and Carsten Pfeiffer <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* dirtree/*: Major rewrite of the directory tree, to make it generic.
	It can now handle toplevel items over to specific modules. Current
	modules available are the dirtree module (directory listing) and the
	history module (for a way to visualize the persistent history).

2000-12-06  Matthias Elter <elter@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Turned the Configure submenu into a single dialog.

2000-12-02  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc (slotToolFind): "Find Files" now embeds the kfind
	part, and the result of the search is connected to the current directory
	part. "Close" or opening any other URL closes the 'find' part.
	Thanks to Eric Coquelle for the kfind classes, and to jpmartin for 
	pushing us to do this :)

	* konq_viewmgr.cc: Support for suicidal passive views, more arguments 
	to splitView and splitWindow.

	* konq_guiclients.cc: Duplicated code removed, uses splitWindow now.

2000-11-30  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Use current profile in "New Window" to fix #16283.

2000-11-28  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_actions.cc: Accel (Alt+O in English) to give focus to location bar,
	shown by the label.

	* konq_profiledlg.cc: Ported to KListView to fix problems with selection.

2000-11-26  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_misc.cc, kfmclient.cc, KonquerorIface.cc: Speed up for URLs opened
	from another process using KRun (e.g. kdesktop's Minicli), by passing the
	mimetype through to konqueror.

2000-11-25  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_misc.cc: Fixed location bar not showing the URL asap.
	
	* konq_mainwindow.cc : Icons for the configure submenu.

	* konq_actions.cc : KonqHistoryAction turned into KToolBarPopupAction.
	Drag the "Location" label to start a drag with the current URL.

2000-11-25  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_view.cc (connectPart): Install new url event filter for plain
	krops and for browserviews with the enableURLDropHandling property enabled
	(eventFilter): New eventfilter which listens for url drop events

Sat Nov 25 17:38:27 2000  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Completion handling overhauled. We have
	one KonqHistoryManager, which holds a KCompletion object and syncs
	the history with the completion.

	* konq_view.cc: 
	set m_bAborted before calling slotCompleted in 	slotCanceled()
	feed the history manager

	* konq_actions.cc: use KonqHistoryCombo that doesn't mess with the
	competion-object, we do our own synchronization now.
	
	* libkonq/ added konq_history*
	
2000-11-22  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_listview.cc: Added "Default" Icon Size, which corresponds to 
	KIcon::Small (but when switching to icon view, it becomes whatever's 
	configured for the "Desktop" group).

2000-11-21  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_listview.cc: Case Insensitive Sort option, on by default.

	* Views: Major rework of the "delayed mimetypes determination" feature,
	to make it available to the list view. This makes the list view
	MUCH faster in big directories.
	This also showed a bug in the listview background painting -> fixed.

2000-11-19  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Views: Implemented in-place renaming of items ("Rename" in menus, F2)

2000-11-17  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_profiledlg.cc: Made checkbox states persistent (saved to config)

	* konq_run.cc: Check that when we call KRun from KonqRun, it's not going
	to launch another konqueror.
	* konq_guiclients.cc: Build toggle-view actions in the actioncollection 
	of the mainwindow, so that it's possible to assign them a shortcut.

2000-11-16  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc: Patch by Keunwoo Lee <klee@cs.washington.edu> to
	implement dynamic accels for the profile submenu.

2000-11-15  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_drag.cc: Export URLs as text/plain as well.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Implemented auto-saving of toolbars (KMainWindow),
	removed "Save Settings".
	Fixed "clicking on directory in dirtree uses wrong view mode for dirs".
	* konq_iconview.cc: Added +/- buttons for changing the icon size.

2000-11-06  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_operations.cc: statURL, calls a slot when it stat'ed
	the url and created a kfileitem for it.
	Used in doDrop when the destination's kfileitem is unknown. Fixes #14739.
	Also, KPropsDlg now does a similar thing when called with a KURL.

2000-11-05  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konqueror.rc: Moved the "open with" actions to the Location menu,
	and added a separator to the action list.

	* konq_view.cc (connectPart): moved call to setSaveViewPropertiesLocally
	(used to be in various places in KonqMW) so that the flag is
	also correct when switching views.

	* konq_dirpart.cc and directory views: apply background color and pixmap
	to the viewport(), and updated konq_iconview to do the same. This fixes
	many inconsistencies, and makes resizing a window much faster & smoother.
	Note that it has to be the viewport and not the widget, otherwise in the
	listview, the box between the scrollbars appears colored/pixmap-ed.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: action renamed View Properties Saved In Directory

2000-11-04  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_viewmgr.cc: now takes care of enableAllActions.
	Show led and active statusbar even in the tree+icon configuration
	(the rule is now "more than one view", not "more than one activeable 
	view"). This should remove some confusion.

	* konq_frame.cc: "Remove View" in RMB on statusbar.
	Don't try to activate passive views when clicking statusbar.
	Different background color on statusbar for active view.

	* konq_mainwindow.cc: Fixes for "Remove Active View" enabling,
	to avoid ending up with a lonely embedded konsole, and some
	cleanup of code for enabling other view-related actions.
	Introducing updateViewActions for common code between enableAllActions
	and slotPartActivated. Fixes a few glitches in action activation.

2000-10-31  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* libkonq: Implemented "Text preview" functionality

2000-10-26  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* keditbookmarks/*: Finally, a bookmark editor for konqueror.
	
	* kbookmarkmanager.*: Separated from kbookmark.* after dcopidl dying on
	"mutable" :). Implemented DCOP notifications between processes.
	Implemented "internal bookmark address". KonqBookmarkManager is no more.

	* kbookmarkbar.*: Update for XML bookmarks, fill in aboutToShow, update
	sub-menus upon changed() signal, enabled "Add Bookmark" and "New Folder"

2000-10-24  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* kbookmark*: Reimplemented the bookmarks, they are now saved in XML.
	Desktop files are imported if the XML file doesn't exist (it's
	immediately saved, so this should happen only once).

2000-10-22  Simon Hausmann  <simon@kde.org>

	* konq_view.{cc,h} : changed part->child( 0, "KParts::BE" ) calls to
	  use the new childObject method in BrowserExtension

2000-10-22  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* dirtree/konq_dirtree.cc: Fixed support for devices in the directory 
	tree. It currently requires MountPoint in the device desktop file.

	* listview/konq_textviewwidget.cc: Only the Name column is now
	selected, and used as a drop area - like in other listviews.
	This requires the fix in KListView to work properly.

2000-10-21  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Fix for linked views saved in profile, introducing isLoadingProfile().

2000-10-20  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* konq_misc.cc: Use webbrowsing profile for *.html *.htm as well.

2000-10-20  Simon Hausmann  <hausmann@kde.org>

	* Duplicate window duplicates the history as well.

[...... long period of development up to KDE 2.0 ommitted .....]
	
1999-03-15  Michael Reiher <michael.reiher@gmx.de>

	* Implemented an ActiveViewIndicator : KonqFrame

1999-02-28  Simon Hausmann <tronical@gmx.net>

	* Rewrite from scratch, with completely new IDL

1999-02-09  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* Source imported in kdebase/konqueror

1999-01-25  Torben Weis  <weis@kde.org>
	
	* Initial import of kfmIII in corba/kfm
