khtml:
======
- (if local dir) : drop should copy to parent dir (for Antonio :)
  more generic approach (idea by lars) : konq installs an eventfilter
  on the part's widget and looks for uri-dnd'events. configurable
  via a bool property on the part (or in the BE)
  that reminds me: dropping urls in the lineedit doesn't work, for
  some strange reason (qlineedit supports it and calls insert())

- #3490, stop animated gifs

libkonq:
========

- Dialog box for choosing bookmark name :
   ( ) [ <Title> ]   (editable)
   ( ) [ <URL> ]     (editable)
 and option in kcmkonqhtml for showing this dialog (on by default ?)

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

- #3350 when moving a file to a directory the box with copy/move/link pops up
even in this box the cursor icon is "forbidden" (_sometimes_). And add Cancel.

- delete file : if image, remove from .xvpics and .mospics/*/

- ordering templates: Find a way to use KServiceGroup for this,
  or "borrow" the code...

konqueror framework:
====================

- Remove highlighted text color and text color from kcmkonq, and settings.

- Do we want "[X] Use directory properties" ?

- Action for enabling/disabling javascript, in Settings.

- the 'shared lib' or interface problem for plugins.

- Bug #2760 and other problems with splitter sizes

- Minicli's current directory (Dawit's last post on kde-cvs was confused I think.
  All we need is chdir() so that apps can find files from the current dir).

- persistent history? as part of profiles?

iconview+listviews:
===================

- Hide backup files (files ending in ~ or #) - see #3212

- if we keep "background color for this directory" should we have "text color for
this directory" too... ?

- (iconview) : Idea by Torsten: Provide (very delayed (in order not to act
               to aggressive)) tooltips for icons, showing delayed information
               like filesize, etc.

listviews:
==========

- textview: dragging from there and dropping in another view crashes, I'm told.

- grep for TODO in the .rc files: missing sorting options: dir firsts, case [in]sensitive

dirtree:
========

- Create dynamic items when browsing non-local URLs (FTP etc.)

kpropsdlg (kfile):
======
- Bug #2717: turning off all read permissions

- Maybe add GUI (in kpropsdlg probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files (example: see eject action in the CDROM template) ?
- Maybe a checkbox for the appstart-notification thing ?

kdesktop:
=========

- Different icons on different desktops (i.e. different directories, Desktop[1-N],
the Desktop one being the 'sticky' icons)

- Dropping an image could offer "set as background pixmap" in the popup

And more:
=========

- Show caitoo in the RMB on links - this is different from usual services,
since it's not associated to a mimetype, but to non-local protocols...

- Action for clearing the location bar (for shortcut)
