/**
 * A template-based insertion sort algorithm, but not really 100%
 * generic. It is mostly written for lists, not for arrays.
 *
 * A good reason to use insertion sort over faster algorithms like
 * heap sort or quick sort, is that it minimizes the number of
 * movements of the items. This is important in applications which support
 * undo, because the number of commands is kept to a minimum.
