	* kfwin.cpp, kfwin.h: The listview items show a mini-pixmap, like those
	in kfiledialog. For now, they're static icons (only folder and document
	icons), maybe we can show the correct icons for the mimetypes, later.

	Also introduced drag-support, you can drag files from the list.

	* kftabdlg.cpp: accept Key_Enter to start the search, too.

	by Dima Rogozin <dima@mercury.co.il>.

1999-04-30  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* kftabdlg.cpp: Default to '*' when no filenames are specified and
	allow case insensitive text search. Patch provided by Dima Rogozin
	<dima@mercury.co.il>.

	* kfind.cpp: replaced simple delete and free() with delete [] iBuffer

1998-11-30  Miroslav Flídr  <flidr@kky.zcu.cz>

	* Dissabled multiple selection in view because it was not fully
	handled
	* Fixed problem in nameBox, dirBox combos which caused improper
	find query generation (it is still neccesary to fix multiplication of
	list entries)

1998-10-23  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>
