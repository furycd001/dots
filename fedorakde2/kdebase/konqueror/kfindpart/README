kfind
=====

Kfind is a graphical replacement for the utility `find' inspired by 
the find utility from NT.

At this time it is fully functional. All options available in kfind
are working. You can save the results, delete, change properties of
found files/directories and ask konqueror to open the directory 
containing this file or execute default binding.

THANKS 
------ 

I want to thank Alexander Sanda <alex@darkstar.ping.at> for making
KTabCtl which is used in Kfind and Torben Weis
<weis@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> for his wonderful file manager konqueror.


I hope you will find this program somehow useful and I would
appreciate any suggestions and comments.
