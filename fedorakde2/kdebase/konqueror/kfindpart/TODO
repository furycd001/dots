TODO
====

 o support the more esoterical features of find
 o support for finding files belonging to somebody

DONE:

 o drag found files to somewhere
 o some layout managment
 o context menus
 o get preference dialog to work 
 o find pattern history
 o write a better widget for viewing results which would enable multiple
   selection (no need for that, QListBox is enough since Qt 1.30)
