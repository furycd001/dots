-Increased version to 1.0.2
-Added Control-Alt-N shortcut key to create new sessions
-Other new items for 1.0.2 added in recent months are session
 management, restoring fullscreen mode, improved startup speed,
 and other fixes and improvements I wish I had remembered to add
 here as they were made.  My thanks to all who have, and continue to,
 contribute.
26 Apr 2001
- Applied patches from bug reports 11353 and 16321, session title is now
  passed to window title and going back and forth from fullscreen mode no
  longer appends extra data to the window title.
20 Dec 2000
- Made ColorSchema a class instead of a struct.
- Added hasSchemaFileChanged() to detect changed .schema files if needed.
- Added checks for new schema files when accessing the schema menu.
- When schema files are removed the corresponding schemas are removed too.
- Fixed some i18n problems in schema.C.
- Laid groundwork for switch to KConfig (from schema files).
- Check for new schema's every time the schema menu is accessed. I realise
  this may be resource intensive on some people's machines. Maybe we need
  a little timeout mechanism to prevent checks all too often.
