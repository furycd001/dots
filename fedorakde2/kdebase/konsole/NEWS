  You need libjpeg, libpng and libqimgio (qt-1.40/extensions) for that.

New in 0.8.5

- rendition is completed, so underline, bold and blinking should
  work properly by now.

- some material related to cursors has been fixed and added.

- some experimental material removed
  - VGA font deactivated by default. This is stuff for a future Linux
    console and ANSI-BBS emulation.
  - variable pitch font support moved to a patch. Result was a disaster
    anyway, since these fonts are not prepared to be used with a terminal
    emulation.

New in 0.8.4

- history buffer and scroll bar added.

New in 0.8.3

- autoconf material

- One may use a background pixmap with konsole, now. This feature is 
  experimental.  It originates from Eterm. To try this, move a pixmap named
  `konsole.ppm' to $HOME/.kde/apps/konsole to try it.  It can be anything
  that QPixmap::load is able to read.  You can get pixmaps from the Eterm
  background tar balls. I've put some into the 'other/' directory, too. Note
  that you need to set fore- and background colors that matches the color of
  the pixmap. The picture will appear tiled in any case.
