	Striking the SET-UP key places you into SET-UP A mode.  SET-UP A is
	basically your tab stops.  Use the space bar to move along the ruler
	and strike the T key at the desired tab stop location.

	SET-UP B may only be entered from SET-UP A and is done be striking
	the 5 on the main keyboard (i.e. top-row).

	To exit SET-UP B strike the SET-UP key.

	The SET-UP parameters are as follows:


  	Bank	Position   Parameters
  
  	1	1	   Scroll;        0=jump;       1=smooth
  	1	2	   Autorepeat;    0=off;        1=on
  	1	3	   Screen;        0=dark;       1=light
  	1	4	   Cursor;        0=underline;  1=block
  
  	2	1	   Margin Bell;   0=off;        1=on
  	2	2	   Keyclick;      0=off;        1=on
  	2	3	   ANSI/VT52;     0=VT52;       1=ANSI
  	2	4	   Auto XON/XOFF; 0=off;        1=on
  
  	3	1	   Pound Sign;    0=octothorpe; 1=British Pound
  	3	2	   Wrap Around;   0=off;        1=on
  	3	3	   New Line;      0=off;        1=on
  	3	4	   Interlace;     0=off;        1=on
  
  	4	1	   Parity Sense;  0=odd;        1=even
  	4	2	   Parity;        0=off;        1=on
  	4	3	   Bits per Char; 0=7 bits;     1=8 bits
  	4	4	   Power;         0=60 Hz;      1=50 Hz

	While in SET-UP B mode, these features are set by positioning the
	cursor above the feature switch, using the spacebar, and striking
	the 6 key on the main keyboard.

	To set the ANSWERBACK MESSAGE, enter SET-UP B and strike the SHIFT
	and A keys simultaneously.  The terminal will respond with A = on
	the screen.  Type a message delimiter character which may be any
	chaacter not used in the actual message.  Type the ANSWERBACK
	MESSAGE, up to 20 characters.  Type the message delimiter
	character.  The message will disappear from the screen.  You may
	not edit an ANSWERBACK MESSAGE.  You may only supercede it with a
	new ANSWERBACK MESSAGE.

	To save the SET-UP, strike the SHIFT and S keys simultaneously,
	while in SET-UP mode.

	I hope this helps.

	Jim

The ANSI Device Status Report (DSR) is

	ESC [ <n> n

where <n> is 5 for a status report (OK reply is "ESC [ 0 n"), and 6
for report cursor position (reply is "ESC [ <row> ; <col> R").

ANSI (and DEC) Send Device Attributes is

	ESC [ <n> c

where <n> is a number, in ASCII 0-9, and usually is 0 for the request.

Here are a (small) selection of replies:

	what			reply			comments

	MacKermit		ESC[?1;2c

	VT100 with STP			ESC[?1;1c

This is cute, but one needs to be careful about assuming what a
terminal emulator will do based on what it claims to be.  There are a
lot of mediocre "emulations" out there.  This is partially because the
ANSI spec allows the terminal to do a lot of weird and unexpected
things, like embedding simple control characters in the middle of an
escape sequence.  ("foo ^H^[^H[^H4^HCbar" should render as "foo bar".
Yuck.)
