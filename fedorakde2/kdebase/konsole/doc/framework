    The terminal emulation framework

The structure of the framework is as follows:

<pre>
              - - - - - - >               - - - - - ->
     TEWidget              VT102Emulation              Shell
              <------------               < - - - - - 
                                  |
                                  |
                                  V
                              TEScreen
</pre>

Within the drawing, a solid line (A --> B) mean A calls B while the dashed
lines means connected by signal.

Thus the AnsiEmulation knows about TEWidget and TEScreen, but not the other
way round. `main.C' connects the whole framework.

The state of the emulation is somewhat like `version 0.8'. It knows most 
xterm/vt100 escape codes and does well with bash, vi and mc right now.

'man' shows a little different output since underlines are missing.

The `Shell' material is a dump but of no real importance.

The current implementation does not longer fit to 'kom' since we
are using block operations with the modem. May be we can implement
this within the main program to indicate the end of bulk there.
