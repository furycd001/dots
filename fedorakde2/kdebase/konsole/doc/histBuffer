[histBuffer]

|Documentation|----------------------------------------------------------------

The `history' is a facility, that allows to get access to lines
scrolled out from the visible part of the display. It is mainly used
to present the complete result of an operation that produces much
output, such as compilation runs.

This facility is offered by virtually any terminal around on Linux.

There are basically two means to control the visible section of the
history. One can both use the keyboard, by pressing Shift-PageUp and
Shift-PageDown, and, if the scrollbar is visible, one can use it to
page through the history also.

Once parts of the history become visible, konsole maintains this
position, even if new text is added to the history meanwhile. Thus, it
is in history display mode. One can revert to normal operation most
quickly by typing any character (which is then not passed to the
application) or scroll down to the end.
