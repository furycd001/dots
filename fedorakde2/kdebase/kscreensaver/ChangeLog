	* bouboule.cpp: the global variable initialized in bouboule is
	used also in qt2. I just renamed the variable to
	bouboule_initialized. However it is just a hack, and I think that
	such global variables are C pratice and not C++

1998-12-13  Christian Esken  <esken@kde.org>

	* Calling kcheckpass (only on Shadow systems). This checks if the password
	database can be acessed. This uses the new return code (#2) by kcheckpass.

1998-10-24  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>

	* bsod.cpp (BSODSaver::BSODSaver): Use srandomdev where available.

1998-10-23  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>

	* bsod.cpp (BSODSaver::BSODSaver): initialize the random seed correctly.

	* amiga.xpm, atari.xbm, bsod.cpp, bsod.h, mac.xbm, AUTHORS, Makefile.am:
	New screensaver: BSOD.  Yay!  Still needs some final polishing however (such as a
	configuration dialog box).

	* saver.h: Add correct C style prototypes for startScreenSaver and friends.

	* main.cpp: Make startScreenSaver and friends use C style name mangling.
