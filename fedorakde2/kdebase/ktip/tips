You might wonder that there are only very few (if any) files whose
names end in <code>.exe</code> or <code>.bat</code> on Unix
systems. This is because filenames on Unix do not need an
extension. Executable files in KDE are represented by the gear icon,
in the Konsole window, they are often colored red (depending on your
settings).

If you need to calculate a distance on the screen, the program
called <em>kruler</em> can be of great help.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if you need to look closely at the ruler to count single
pixels, then <em>kmag</em> may be very useful. (It is not part of the KDE base
installation but needs to be installed separately. It might already be
available on your distribution.) <em>kmag</em> works
just like <em>xmag</em>, with the difference that it magnifies on the fly.
