This is KWin, kwm next generation.

Currently supported options in the kwinrc:

    /*!
      Different focus policies:
      <ul>

      <li>ClickToFocus - Clicking into a window activates it. This is
      also the default.

      <li>FocusFollowsMouse - Moving the mouse pointer actively onto a
      normal window activates it. For convenience, the desktop and
      windows on the dock are excluded. They require clicking.

      <li>FocusUnderMouse - The window that happens to be under the
      mouse pointer becomes active. The invariant is: no window can
      have focus that is not under the mouse. This also means that
      Alt-Tab won't work properly and popup dialogs are usually
      usable with the keyboard. Note that the desktop and windows on
      the dock are excluded for convenience. They get focus only when
      clicking on it.

      <li>FocusStrictlyUnderMouse - this is even worse than
      FocusUnderMouse. Only the window under the mouse pointer is
      active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has the focus. If
      the mouse points onto the desktop, the desktop has focus. The
      same holds for windows on the dock.

      Note that FocusUnderMouse and FocusStrictlyUnderMouse are not
      particularly useful. They are only provided for old-fashioned
      die-hard UNIX people ;-)

      </ul>

FocusPolicy=ClickToFocus | FocusFollowsMouse | FocusUnderMouse | FocusStrictlyUnderMouse


    /**
       Different Alt-Tab-Styles:
       <ul>
       
       <li> KDE - the recommended KDE style. Alt-Tab opens a nice icon
       box that makes it easy to select the window you want to tab
       to. The order automatically adjusts to the most recently used
       windows. Note that KDE style does not work with the
       FocusUnderMouse and FocusStrictlyUnderMouse focus
       policies. Choose ClickToFocus or FocusFollowsMouse instead.
       
       <li> CDE - the old-fashion CDE style. Alt-Tab cycles between
       the windows in static order. The current window gets raised,
       the previous window gets lowered.
       
       </ul>
