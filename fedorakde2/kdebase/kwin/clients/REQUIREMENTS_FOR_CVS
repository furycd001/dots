If you are looking to include a C++ KWin style client in CVS make sure you
follow the following requirements:

A) You must follow the current color scheme for all decorations. *No* fixed
pixmaps are allowed for the clients. If you wish to draw your decorations
use as few shades as possible, then use kpixmap2bitmap in kdegraphics
to convert them into individual bitmaps. Once this is done you can
draw the bitmaps using a colorgroup with kColorBitmaps.

If your client is just a set of pixmaps that doesn't follow any of the options
I suggest you make a KWM theme so the user gets those options to 
configure the pixmaps and look. Making a plain pixmapped dedicated style 
makes no sense since it is less configurable than KWM themes and cannot follow
client plugin options. 

B) You must follow at least the color settings in the Options class.
