>This MUST be set by the Client before mapping, to a list of atoms indicating
the functional type of the window.  This property SHOULD be used by the window
manager in determining the decoration, stacking position and other behaviour
of the window.  The Client SHOULD specify window types in order of preference
(the first being most preferable), but MUST include at least one of the basic
window type atoms from the list below.  This is to allow for extension of the
list of types, whilst providing default behaviour for window managers that do
not recognise the extensions.  
	</P
><P
>Rationale:  This hint is intend to replace the MOTIF hints.  One of the
objections to the MOTIF hints is that they are a purely visual description of
the window decoration.  By describing the function of the window, the window
manager can apply consistent decoration and behaviour to windows of the same
type.  Possible examples of behaviour include keeping dock/panels on top or
allowing pinnable menus / toolbars to only be hidden when another window has
focus (NextStep style).

border of the screen.  The order of the borders is left, right, top, bottom.
The client MAY change this property anytime, therefore the Window Manager MUST
watch out for property notify events.  
	</P
><P
>The purpose of struts is to reserve space at the borders of the desktop.  This
is very useful for a docking area, a taskbar or a panel, for instance.  The
window manager should know about this reserved space in order to be able to
preserve the space. Also maximized windows should not cover that reserved
space.
	</P
><P
>Rationale: A simple "do not cover" hint is not enough for dealing with e.g.
auto-hide panels. 
	</P
><P
>Notes: An auto-hide panel SHOULD set the strut to be its minimum, hidden size.
A "corner" panel that does not extend for the full length of a screen border
SHOULD only set one strut.
