>Desktop/workspace model</A
></H2
><P
>This spec assumes a desktop model that consists of one or more completely
independent desktops which may or may not be larger than the screen area.
When a desktop is larger than the screen it is left to the window manager if
it will implement scrolling or paging.

>File Manager desktop</A
></H2
><P
>This spec suggests implementing the file manager desktop by mapping a
desktop-sized window (no shape) to all desktops, with
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP.  This makes the desktop focusable and greatly
simplifies implementation of the file manager.  It is also faster than
managing lots of small shaped windows. The file manager draws the background
on this window.  There should be a root property with a window handle for use
in applications that want to draw the background (xearth).

>Several GNOME file manager developers have accepted this model

>Implementing enhanced support for application transient windows</A
></H2
><P
>If the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property is set to None or Root window, the window
should be treated as a transient for all other windows in the same group.  It
has been noted that this is a slight ICCCM violation, but as this behaviour is
pretty standard for many toolkits and window managers, and is extremely
unlikely to break anything, it seems reasonable to document it as standard.

Window Managers that require / desire additional functionality beyond what can be acheived using the mechanisms set out in this specification may choose to implement their own pagers, which communicates with the Window Manager using further, WM-specific hints, or some other means.

>Window Movement</A
></H2
><P
>According to the ICCCM, applications should not see unnecessary differences
between running with or without a window manager. Therefore window movements
for already mapped windows, such as ones requested by XMoveWindow(Display,
Window, X, Y) have to move the window Window to the coordinates (X, Y) and not
cause the window's window manager frame window to end up at (X, Y).

Application authors are advised to use some other form of MDI, or to propose a mechanism to be included in the next revision of this specification.
