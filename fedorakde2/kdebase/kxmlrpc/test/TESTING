Testing the KDE XmlRpc Daemon
=============================
So you want to see if this works, eh?  Well, you've come to the right
place.  This directory contains a few files that you can use for just
that purpose.

The two files here are:
testxmlrpc.cpp -- sample DCOP client (server)
testxmlrpc.py  -- python xmlrpc client
testxmlrpc.sh  -- Bourne shell(!) xmlrpc client

You'll note that none directly use the kxmlrpcd daemon.  That is
because the daemon should be *totally* transparent to both the xmlrpc
client and the dcop client/server.  Neither should have clue that they
are going through this daemon.

textxmlrpc.cpp
--------------
The testxmlrpc.cpp file is a DCOP client/server that acts like a (very
very) simple address book.  It has three remote functions:

QCString lookup(QCString name)
  - This will return an email address given a name.  For instance,
    lookup("Kurt Granroth") will return "granroth@kde.org"

void addAddress(QCString name, QCString address)
  - Will add an entry

void deleteAddress(QCString name)
  - Will delete an entry

The server name is 'testxmlrpc' and the object is 'email'

Compile it like so:
g++ -o testxmlrpc testxmlrpc.cpp -I$KDEDIR/include -I$QTDIR/include -L$KDEDIR/lib -L$QTDIR/lib -lkdecore -lqt

Then, make sure that 'dcopserver' is running and start ./testxmlrpc

testxmlrpc.py
-------------
This file is a python xmlrpc client.  It requires a python library to
run.  You can get it at:

  http://www.pythonware.com/downloads/xmlrpc-0.9.8-990621.zip

Unzip this into your python dir (/usr/lib/python1.5, for instance)

Now make sure that the kxmlrpcd daemon is running and type
./testxmlrpc.py

testxmlrpc.sh
-------------
This is a standard shell script using only /bin/sh, cat, sed, and
telnet -- all of which are on ALL Unix systems.  Ergo, you don't need
to download anything.

Make sure kxmlrpcd and kdesktop are running and type
./testxmlrpc.sh

Notes
-----
I included the python client only because python has by *far* the best
implementation of xmlrpc (check out the code to see how incredibly
easy it is to use).  There are, however, clients for many many
different languages.  Check out http://www.xmlrpc.com for more of
them, if you like
