GENERAL
=======
In KDE 2 we added support for localization of dates, time, numbers and
money. KDE will use this when displaying such information, giving you a
feeling that KDE was written to fit your national standards. To make this
possible, we need to gather some information on your national standards.
Currently is over 70 countries supported. If your contry is missing, please
let us know.

HOW TO ADD INFORMATION
======================
First you have to write a file called "ENTRY.DESKTOP". This file will
describe your national standards. Please read the section below for more
information on that.

You will need a nice flag for your country. The size should be 21x14 pixles,
and it should be called "flag.png".

To add your information, we need a two letter country code for you country.
Use http://www.tu-berlin.de/zrz/dienste/netz/mail/iso-3166.html as a guide.

Now you are done, and you can commit the files to KDE project by sending a
mail to Hans Petter Bieker <bieker@kde.org>. The files will be added in the
next release. Please include the country code in the mail.

WHAT IS ENTRY.DESKTOP
=====================
entry.desktop is a file which defines a locale for a country. It's stored
the same way as the rest of the KDE configuration files. The very first line
should only contain "[KCM Locale]". The rest of the file should contain one
line for each of the entries below. Add "=" between the entry name and the
value.
