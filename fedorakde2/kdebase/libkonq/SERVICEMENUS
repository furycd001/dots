This file explains how to add an item in the popupmenu (for both
konqueror and kdesktop), without using the file associations.

Why
===
One reason for doing this is being able to associate
some action with all files without this action becoming a default handler
(called on left click).
Another is that for text-based programs and tools (e.g. gzip) it's faster
than defining a desktop file for the application, making it hidden, and
associate it with the relevant file types.

How
===
Create a file ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/something.desktop
and write into it something like (without the comments) :

[Desktop Entry]
ServiceTypes=text/html,text/plain # use allfiles (alone) for all files
                                  # and use inode/directory for dirs only
Actions=gzip;mail                 # those are ';' separated, per the standard !

[Desktop Action gzip]            # One "Desktop Action <name>" group per Action
Name=GZip this file
Name[fr]=...
Icon=tgz
Exec=gzip %f

[Desktop Action mail]
Name=Mail this file
Name[fr]=...
Icon=kmail
Exec=kmail --there-is-no-such-option-yet %f


See also the "desktop entry standard", which defines more formally the same
concept of actions but for desktop files (e.g. eject on a device desktop file,
etc.)
