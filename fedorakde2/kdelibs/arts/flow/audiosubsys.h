 * BC - Status (2000-09-30): AudioSubSystem, ASProducer, ASConsumer.
 *
 * These classes are kept binary compatible. You can rely on them.
 * AudioSubSystem has a private data pointer to do so. Even if ports to
 * other architectures or hardware will require different organization
 * (i.e. no fragments, direct memory access via mmap), the data members
 * and functions exported here MAY NOT BE CHANGED. Use the private data
 * pointer for adding data members.
 *
 * If ASProducer/ASConsumer doesn't suit the needs any longer, do NOT
 * change them. Add new classes instead.
