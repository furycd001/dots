About KNotify 

Historic overview. From KDE-1 to KDE-2:
---------------------------------------
KDE-1 ships with a notification system for window manager events - a sound could
be played for example on startup or when a window closes. This was a very limited
notification system.

KNotify in contrast is a very flexible notification system. It can easily be
accessed by any application, and notifications can have several presentations:
Sound is still supported, but you can as well display a message box, write a text
to a log file or log window.

The notification presentation will be user configurable. Some people don't like
message boxes popping up at unexpected times, so they prefer sounds instead.
Deaf people on the otehr hand will not be happy about desktop sounds.



Usage:
------
1. Compile
2. Start knotify
3. Test it with knotifyclient.

Ideas:
------
It might be useful to modify message presentation from time to time. For example,
while the screen is locked, it is very likely that the user is not present. Thus,
he will not be able to hear a "You have mail" sound (or to see a talk request).
Re-routing this to a log window sounds like a very good ideas.
