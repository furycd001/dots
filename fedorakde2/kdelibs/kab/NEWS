October 10, 1998:
	I started writing a dialog base class that in future all dialogs 
	will be derived from. It is suited with already-connected standard
	buttons (OK, Apply, Cancel) and some nice visual features (outer
	and inner frame, a common background pixmap for the frames) and
	with ready-to-use geometry management. Hopefully providing cute
	dialogs will became easier now.
	The new dialogs that use this common base class have a main widget
	they manage inside their inner frame. I usually create this widgets 
	with qtarch. 
	And I started to write the NEWS file :-)

	You may click on the email address in the about dialog to send me an
	email now.
November 4, 1998:
	Did you ever wonder that the "Edit email address" dialog was nearly
	unusable? If you did, you should have a look at it. It has been 
	improved to be more intuitive.
	The bug that prevented you from storing something in the country 
	fields has been removed now.
	The dialog for editing the entry is now resized more properly.
November 22, 1998:
	You may now click on the URL or email address that is displayed in 
	the business card, both are interactive now.
