The KDE addressbook
===================

This directory contains the sources for the kab API provided by
"libkab.so". kab is the KDE addressbook, users usually know it by one of
the applications using the kab API, kab itselfes. But kab intends to do
more, it tries to be a central database to store personal information for
as much KDE applications as possible.

To compile this subdirectory, your C++ compiler will be stressed a little.  
You need either a recent version of gcc (2.7.2 or later) or egcs (1.0.2 or
later), or another C++ compiler that supports the following things:

* error free (!) creation of template instances,
* a STL implementation that is similar to either the one provided by gcc
2.7 or the one provided by egcs/pgcc or gcc >=2.8 (HP or SGI based).

Please note that egcs / pgcc 1.0.2 creates errors in the binary when you
compile the sources using optimization level 6 (-O6).  Stick to -O2, and
it should work. Note: This seems to be solved since gcc 2.95.

Since this directory provides only the kab library, you will have to
install the kdeutils package, that contains the sources for kab's binary,
also.

PS: The situation described above seems to be solved in current
distributions. All up-to-date compilers do quite well on the sources.
