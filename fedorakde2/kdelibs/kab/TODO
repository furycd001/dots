The KDE addressbook
================================================================================
If you want kab to be extended, please send a mail to me. Also 
contact me if you want to comment some of the features mentioned 
below. Send the mail to mirko@kde.org
Thanks.
PS: I am still looking for volunteers who try writing the import filters. 
    Most often I do not have the different other addressbook programs myselfes.
PS1: This TODO list deals with tasks to add to the KDE addressbook
library. If you want the application to be extended, read kdeutils/kab/TODO.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
° [done] change mail addresses to an unlimited list with selection before
         sending an email
° [done] allow user to add custom fields
° [partly implemented] a searchable keyword field
° automatic menus for kmail and ktalk -> a matter of the applications
° [done for HTML in KDE 1.1] add export methods
° [done, even more flexible] 
  enhance the telephone numbers section, using home/work/..., 
  fixed/mobile, and so on
° [done] some functions in the main display, like clickable parts 
  (email/talk addresses, possibly telephony support?),
° [done] IMPORTANT: Possibility to use different files and, most important, 
  common addressbooks for different people.
° add "Nick name" field (after KDE 2.0)
° improve speed of database indexing
