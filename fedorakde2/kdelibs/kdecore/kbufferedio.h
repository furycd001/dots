/**
 * Buffered I/O
 *
 * This abstract class implements basic functionality for buffered
 * input/output.
 *
 * Through the available methods, you can find out how many bytes are
 * available for reading, how many are still unsent and you can peek at
 * the buffered data.
 *
 * This class was intentionally written to resemble QSocket, because
 * @ref KExtendedSocket is a subclass of this one. This is so that applications
 * written using QSocket's buffering characteristics will be more easily
 * ported to the more powerful KExtendedSocket class.
 *
 * KBufferedIO already provides a powerful internal buffering algorithm. However,
 * this does not include the I/O itself, which must be implemented in
 * derived classes. Thus, to implement a class that does some I/O, you must
 * override, in addition to the pure virtual QIODevice methods, these three:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>closeNow</li>
 *  <li>waitForMore</li>
 *  <li></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If your derived class reimplements the buffering algorithm, you must then
 * decide which buffering functions to override. For instance, you may want to
 * change the protected functions like @ref feedReadBuffer and @ref consumeReadBuffer.
