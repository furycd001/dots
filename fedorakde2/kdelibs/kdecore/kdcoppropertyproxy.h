/**
 * The KDCOPPropertyProxy class provides an easy way to publish Qt properties of a
 * QObject through DCOP.
 *
 * The class provides DCOP equivalents for the Qt property methods setProperty() ,
 * property() and propertyNames() and also provides automatic set/get methods for
 * the properties of a QObject. That means for example if your object provides a
 * QString property called foo , then KDCOPPropertyProxy translates DCOP calls
 * "setFoo( QString )" and "QString foo()" automatically into the corresponding
 * setProperty/property calls.
