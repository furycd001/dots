/**
 * This namespace provides a method for issuing events to a KNotifyServer
 * call KNotifyClient::event("eventname"); to issue it.
 * On installation, there should be a file called
 * $KDEDIR/share/apps/appname/eventsrc which contains the events.
 *
 * The file looks like this:
 * <pre>
 * [!Global!]
 * IconName=Filename (e.g. kdesktop, without any extension)
 * Comment=FriendlyNameOfApp
 *
 * [eventname]
 * Name=FriendlyNameOfEvent
 * Comment=Description Of Event
 * default_sound=filetoplay.wav
 * default_presentation=1
 *  ...
 * </pre>
 * default_presentation contains these ORed events:
 *	None=0, Sound=1, Messagebox=2, Logfile=4, Stderr=8
 *
 * You can also use the "nopresentation" key, with any the presentations
 * ORed.  Those that are in that field will not appear in the kcontrol
 * module.  This was intended for software like KWin to not allow a window-opening
 * that opens a window (e.g., allowing to disable KMessageBoxes from appearing)
 * If the user edits the eventsrc file manually, it will appear.  This only
 * affects the KcmNotify.
 *
 * You can also use the following events, which are system controlled
 * and do not need to be placed in your eventsrc:
 *
 *<ul>
 * <li>cannotopenfile
 * <li>notification
 * <li>warning
 * <li>fatalerror
 * <li>catastrophe
 *</ul>
