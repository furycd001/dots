/**
 * Reference counting for shared objects.  If you derive your object
 * from this class, then you may use it in conjunction with
 * @ref KSharedPtr to control the lifetime of your object.
 *
 * Specifically, all classes that derive from KShared have an internal
 * counter keeping track of how many other objects have a reference to
 * their object.  If used with @ref KSharedPtr, then your object will
 * not be deleted until all references to the object have been
 * released.
 *
 * You should probably not ever use any of the methods in this class
 * directly -- let the @ref KSharedPtr take care of that.  Just derive
 * your class from KShared and forget about it.
