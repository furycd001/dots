- Uses KDE language in IPP requests instead of standard CUPS
  language.

- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Add icon for view selection in the toolbar

- Implement a generic page selection mechanism around the psselect
  utility if available

- Pamphlet printing:
    * psbook to reorder the pages
    * psnup to put 2 pages on 1 sheet
    * psselect to separate in even and odd pages
    * print successively odd then even pages (asking user to put
      printed pages again in slot)
  OR
    * use 2 different filters to print: one for even pages, the other
      for odd pages (no code change needed then)

- Use another tool for preview (maybe difficult to know if we want to
  continue or not)

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???
