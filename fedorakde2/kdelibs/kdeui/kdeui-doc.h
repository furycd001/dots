/**
* @libdoc The KDE User Interface library
*
* This library provides standard user interface elements for use in
* KDE applications. If your KDE application has a GUI, you will almost
* certainly link to libkdeui.
*
* Most applications with single or multiple toplevel widgets
* should use the @ref KMainWindow class in this library, which
* automatically provides features like session management and simplified
* toolbar/menubar/statusbar creation.
