/**
 * This class provides the standard KDE help menu with the default "about"
 * dialog boxes and help entry.
 *
 * This class is used in @ref KMainWindow so
 * normally you don't need to use this class yourself. However, if you
 * need the help menu or any of its dialog boxes in your code that is
 * not subclassed from @ref KMainWindow you should use this class.
 *
 * The usage is simple:
 *
 * <pre>
 * mHelpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this, <someText> );
 * kmenubar->insertItem(i18n("&Help"), mHelpMenu->menu() );
 * </pre>
 *
 * or if you just want to open a dialog box:
 *
 * <pre>
 * mHelpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this, <someText> );
 * connect( this, SIGNAL(someSignal()), mHelpMenu,SLOT(mHelpMenu->aboutKDE()));
 * </pre>
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * The first time you use mHelpMenu->menu(), a @ref KPopupMenu object is
 * allocated. Only one object is created by the class so if you call
 * @ref mHelpMenu->menu() twice or more, the same pointer is returned. The class
 * will destroy the popupmenu in the destructor so do not delete this
 * pointer yourself.
 *
 * The @ref KHelpMenu object will be deleted when its parent is destroyed but you
 * can delete it yourself if you want. The code below will always work.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MyClass::~MyClass()
 * {
 *   delete mHelpMenu;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * Using your own "about application" dialog box:
 *
 * The standard "about application" dialog box is quite simple. If you
 * need a dialog box with more functionality you must design that one
 * yourself. When you want to display the dialog you can choose one of
 * two methods. Common for both is that you must make a help menu object
 * with no text argument If the text is missing the default dialog box
 * will not be displayed:
 *
 * Example 1 Using @ref showAboutApplication signal (preferred)
 * <pre>
 *
 * void MyClass::myFunc()
 * {
 *   ..
 *   KHelpMenu *helpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this );
 *   connect( helpMenu, SIGNAL(showAboutApplication()),
 *          this, SLOT(myDialogSlot()));
 *   ..
 * }
 *
 * void MyClass::myDialogSlot()
 * {
 *   <activate your custom dialog>
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * Example 2 Old style - connecting directly to the menu entry.
 * <pre>
 *
 * void MyClass::myFunc()
 * {
 *   KHelpMenu *helpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this );
 *   KPopupMenu *help = mHelpMenu->menu();
 *   help->connectItem( KHelpMenu::menuAboutApp, this, SLOT(myDialogSlot()) );
 * }
 *
 * void MyClass::myDialogSlot()
 * {
 *   <activate your custom dialog>
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @short Standard KDE help menu with dialog boxes.
