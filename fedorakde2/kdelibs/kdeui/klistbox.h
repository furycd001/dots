 * @ref QListBox::clicked() or @ref QListBox::doubleClicked()
 * depending on the KDE wide Single Click/Double Click settings. It is
 * strongly recomended that you use this signal instead of the above
 * mentioned. This way you don´t need to care about the current
 * settings.  If you want to get informed when the user selects
 * something connect to the @ref QListBox::selectionChanged() signal.
