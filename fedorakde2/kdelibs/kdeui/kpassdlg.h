/**
 * This dialog asks the user to enter a password. The functions you're 
 * probably interested in are the static methods, @ref #getPassword() and
 * @ref #getNewPassword().
 *
 * @sect Usage example
 *
 * <pre>
 * QCString password;
 * int result = KPasswordDialog::getPassword(password, i18n("Password"));
 * if (result == KPasswordDialog::Accepted)
 *     use(password);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @sect Security notes
 *
 * Keeping passwords in memory can be a potential security hole. You should
 * handle this situation with care.
 *
 * @li You may want to use @ref #disableCoreDump() to disable core dumps. 
 * Core dumps are dangerous because they are an image of the process memory, 
 * and thus include any passwords that were in memory.
 *
 * @li You should delete passwords as soon as they are not needed anymore.
 * The functions @ref #getPassword() and @ref #getNewPassword() return the 
 * password as a QCString. I believe this is safer than a QString. A QString 
 * stores its characters internally as 16-bit wide values, so conversions are 
 * needed, both for creating the QString and by using it. The temporary 
 * memory used for these conversion is probably not erased. This could lead 
 * to stray  passwords in memory, even if you think you erased all of them.
