/**
* General-purpose multi-page dialog.
*
* KWizard is a class for a multi-page dialog. The user can navigate trough
* the pages with "Next" and "Back" buttons and is optionally offered "Finish",
* "Cancel" and "Help" buttons. A wizard comes in handy for tutorials or
* configuration dialogs with sequential steps.  
* 
* @ref KWizard is just a wrapper for Qt's @ref QWizard class. See the
* @ref QWizard documentation for a detailed description of available
* functions. The only added functionality is a KDE conformant translation
* mechanism for the built-in buttons.
