    USAGE

TEMPORARY FIX: Do not use a three-place version number in the DOCTYPE
declarations.  The docbook tools contain a bug such that it cannot
handle these.  The fix consists of using the version number V4.1
instead of 4.1.2.  Reverting to 4.1 seems to introduce a pile of
catalog errors I'd rather stay away from (they're easy to fix though).

    Refer to this DTD as

      "-//KDE//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2-Based Variant V1.0//EN"

    For instance:

      <!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//KDE//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2-Based Variant V1.0//EN"
                     "customization/dtd/kdex.dtd">

    and use catalog as the catalogue file.
    Note: the system identifier is interpreted relative to the place
    where it is defined, unless otherwise defined by the application you use.
    If you have permanent internet access, you can use any URLs (and
    you don't have to install docbook).
