# Start the common desktop tools in the background.
# The sleeps reduce disk usage during startup.

# kaudioserver now is smart and needs no "sleep 1" anymore
#kaudioserver
# until aRts is finished, this is commented out, or it takes 11 seconds
# of startup time to timeout.  Makes startkde take far too long.

# kded is smart and forks as well

# Use -x-root with kwm

# Add -ncols 96 after konqueror if using a 8-bit display 
# (sleep 1 && exec konqueror) &
# konqueror is not started here anymore
# click on a backgroup icon to start it, if not started by session management
