WARNING:
  DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY YET.  IT IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND MAY
  CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

This library includes cryptographic software written by Eric Young
(eay@cryptsoft.com).

This set of classes is designed to make SSL easier to integrate in KDE
applications.  It currently uses OpenSSL and if it is not successfully
compiled with OpenSSL, then it will do virtually nothing.  The SSL settings
for a user are shared across applications and managed with the kcontrol
module "crypto".  If this file is not updated by release, you can contact
the author for development information.
