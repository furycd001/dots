This file describes the current known bugs in QStyle/KStyle/KThemeXXX...

If you are developing code feel free to add to this if you like and hopefully
close some ;-) If you are a cvsup user feel free to email me.

There is a bug in check/radioboxes when using masks. At various times it
seems to mask the text incorrectly causing it to be incomprehensible. When
this occurs, it also happens with the Qt examples such as wood. It seems to
happen when there are layout problems (ie: setMinimumSize to a invalid
sizeHint()).
Status: Closed. TT fixed this 2 days after the report :) (mosfet 4/27)

Check/radioboxes/sliders should be able to be any size pixmap, but drawXXXMask
seems to send the wrong y coordinates on some sizes. Currently y is fixed to
y-2 which works for 16x16 pixmaps.
Status: Closed (Mosfet)

When I use a pixmapped slider groove it messes with the slider itself. This
has been disabled for now.
Status: Closed (Mosfet)

My scrollbar metrics seem to be a little off and if you change styles
dynamically through KApp or if the scrollbar contents are too large
the linestep buttons get overwritten with the background.
Status: Closed (Mosfet)

In KApp's KDEChangeGeneral atom handler it clears the background pixmap. I
think this is due to the palette being reloaded after QStyle::polish but I
have not found where.
Status: Closed (Mosfet)

* Deller (05/03/99) [deller@gmx.de]
KStyles are currently not usable on other archs, where the default ending
of shared libraries is not .so (=Linux,ELF?). As example on HP-UX the
default ending is .sl -> Example: "libbasicstyle.sl". The .kdelnk files
have to be corrected (maybe via Perl-Script ??).
Status: Open (I think coolo has fixed this now? - mosfet)
