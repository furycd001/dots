			  INSTALLING Qt FOR X11


You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
where you choose to install Qt.


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /usr/local
	gunzip qt-x11-2.3.2.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-x11-2.3.2.tar	# unpack it

    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-2.3.2 containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename qt-2.3.2 to qt (or make a symlink):

	mv qt-2.3.2 qt

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. (Create the
    file if it is not there already.)

	QTDIR		   - wherever you installed Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	MANPATH 	   - to access the Qt man pages
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH	   - for the shared Qt library

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

	QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $QTDIR
    is set.  The installation will give an error message and not
    proceed otherwise.


3.  Install your license file as $HOME/.qt-license.
    For the free edition, you do not need a license file.  For Professional
    and Enterprise editions, install your license file as described in your
    distribution.


4.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (eg. the Designer).

    Type:

	./configure

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all examples and the tutorial:

	make

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, read PORTING.  If it is
    supported but you have problems, see http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/


5.  In very few cases you may need to run /sbin/ldconfig or something
    similar at this point if you are using shared libraries.

    If you have problems running the example programs, e.g. messages like

	 can't load library 'libqt.so.2'

    you probably need to put a reference to the qt library in a
    configuration file and run /sbin/ldconfig as root on your system.
    And don't forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as explained in 2) above.


6.  The online HTML documentation is installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/html/
    The main page is /usr/local/qt/doc/html/index.html
    The man pages are installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/man/



That's all.  Qt is now installed.
