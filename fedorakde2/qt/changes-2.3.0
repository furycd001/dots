Qt 2.3 introduces some new features as well as improvements over the
2.2.x series. This file will give an overview of the main changes
since version 2.2. For more detail see the online documentation which
is included in this distribution, and also available on
http://doc.trolltech.com/

The Qt version 2.3 series is binary compatible with the 2.2.x and
2.1.x series - applications compiled for 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2 will
continue to run with 2.3.

As with previous Qt releases, the API and functionality of Qt is
completely portable between Microsoft Windows, X11, and Qt/Embedded.
It is also portable between Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000.

*			    Overview					   *
****************************************************************************

The main reason for this Qt release is the latest development on the
Unix/X11 platform. The newly developed Xft extension included in XFree
4.0.2 finally enables applications to do antialiased font rendering on
X11. We feel that Qt users should get access to this feature as soon
as possible, that's why we offer a new Qt release supporting it. Most
other changes in Qt 2.3 are minor and could have gone into a
maintainance release. Applications developed with Qt 2.x should run
with Qt 2.3 without problems.

In addition, we extended printing support on Unix/X11. QPSPrinter is
now able to embed True Type and Postscript fonts into the generated
doument rather than relying on the installed printer fonts.


****************************************************************************
* 		New major features in existing classes			   *
****************************************************************************

- X11		Qt now has full support for antialiased fonts on X11 via 
		the Xft	extension.
		The only XServer supporting this feature is currently
		XFree86 (> 4.0.2). Applications running on other XServers
		will not see a difference and continue using the old font
		system.
		A new option -xft has been added to the configure script
		to enable or disable xft support at compile time.
		Xft support can be enabled or disabled at application 
		startup	time by setting the environment variable QT_XFT to 
		'true'.	Antaliased fonts are not enabled by default, as 
		most XServers still don't support it. Enabling/disabling 
		Xft support is completely transparent to the application 
		itself.

- QPSPrinter    True type and Postscript fonts used will now be embedded
		into the generated document. This will make fonts on the
		printer look exactly like the output on the screen if the
		application uses true type or postscript fonts.
		Added better support for printing of asian languages.
		Added a font replacement algorithm to get better looking
		results in the cases where font embedding is not possible.

- QImage	If you use the "PBM" format, the output will be a
		monochrome image. Use "PPM" if you want color.


QScrollView     new ResizePolicy "AutoOneFit"

****************************************************************************
*				Bug fixes				   *
****************************************************************************

- MS-Windows	Fixed some problems with text input of asian languages
		on Nt & Win2000.
		Disabled palette supports system settings better

- X11		Fixed a segfault in QFont with asian fontsets.
		Better support for people switching keyboards on the
		fly. Most keyboard input should now be recognised even if
		the locale of the keyboard and of the application do not 
		match.	

- Gif decoder	minor bugfixes

- QEffects	reduced flicker for blending and fixed direction bug for 
		scrolling sub-menus

- QFontDataBase	added a isFixedPitch() function

- QPrinter	don't invert margins when printing in full page mode on 
		windows.

- QPainter	MS-Windows only: Fixed some clipping issues on windows 
		when using several painters.

- QPSPrinter	The generated postscript will now cooperate well with
		post processing tools such as 'psnup'
		Center printed postscript correctly on the page when
		printing in landscape mode.

- QThread	Some fixes in wait().

- QWaitCondition  Return the correct value in wait
