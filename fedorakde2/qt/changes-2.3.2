Qt 2.3.2 is a bugfix release. It keeps both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 2.3.1


****************************************************************************
*			    General					   *
****************************************************************************

- Improved build on
	Unixware CC
	Solaris-64 / Forte 6
	gcc 3.0
	VisualAge C++ 5.0.2

- Popup menus on Unix/X11
	Popup menus on X11 since Qt 2.2.4 did not grab the keyboard
	anymore, but relied on and enforced the application to have
	focus. This worked around an X11 bug where deadkeys did not
	work while the keyboard was grabbed. This release reverts the
	workaround and introduces a proper fix using the Xkb
	extension.

- Miscellaneous
	Many bug fixes including but not limited to potential
	crashes, memory leaks, possible endless loops, layout and
	drawing errors. ASSERT macro does no longer cause problems
	within blocks.

	corresponding mouse move is for a widget that is blocked by a
	modal event loop

	situations)

- QLineEdit
	fixed cursor and selection position after del(). Override

- QPixmap
	xForm() now respects the optimization settings of the
	pixmap

- QPopupMenu

	performance optimizations. fixed focus policy (wheel focus).
	let up/down keys skip hidden rows. Some workaround for
	QRegion range limitations on certain window systems. Take the
	pixmap of a header section into account when adjusting the
	size
