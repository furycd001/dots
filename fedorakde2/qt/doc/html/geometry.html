<h1 align=center> Window Geometry</h1><br clear="all">
<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>
QWidget provides several functions that deal with a widget's
geometry.  Some of these functions operate on the pure client area
(i.e. the window excluding the window frame), others include the
window frame. The differentiation is done in a way that covers the
most common usage transparently.
<p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Including the window frame:</strong>
  <dd>x(), y(), frameGeometry(), pos() and move()
  <dt><strong>Excluding the window frame:</strong>
  <dd> geometry(), width(), height(), rect() and size()
</dl>
<p>
Note that the distinction only matters for decorated top-level
widgets. For all child widgets, the frame geometry is equal to the
widget's client geometry.
<p>

<h2> Unix/X11 peculiarities </h2>
<p>
On Unix/X11, a window does not have a frame until the window manager
decorates it. This happens asynchronously at some point in time after
calling show() and the first paint event the window receives - or it
does not happen at all. Keep in mind that X11 is policy-free (others
call it flexible). Thus you cannot make any safe assumption about the
decoration frame your window will get. Basic rule: There's always one
user who uses a window manager that breaks your assumption, and who
will complain to you.
<p>
Furthermore, a toolkit cannot simply place windows on the screen. All
Qt can do is to send certain hints to the window manager. The window
manager, a separate process, may either obey, ignore or misunderstand
them. Due to the partially unclear Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual (ICCCM), window placement is handled quite
differently in existing window managers.
<p>
X11 provides no standard or easy way to get the frame geometry once
the window got decorated. Qt solves this problem with nifty heuristics
and clever code that works on a wide range of window managers that
exist today. Don't be surprised if you find one where frameGeometry()
returns bogus results, though.
<p>
X11 also does not provide a way to maximize a window. The
showMaximized() function in Qt therefore has to emulate the
feature. Its result depends totally on the result of frameGeometry()
and the capability of the window manager to do proper window
placement, both of which cannot be guaranteed.
<p>
<h2>Restoring a Window's Geometry</h2>
<p>
A common task in modern applications is to restore a window's geometry
in a later session. On Windows, this is basically storing the result
of geometry() and calling setGeometry() in the next session before
doing show(). On X11, this won't work because an invisible window
doesn't have a frame yet. The window manager would decorate the window
later. When this happens, the window shifts towards the bottom/right
corner of the screen depending on the size of the decoration frame. X
theoretically provides a way to avoid this shift. Our tests have
shown, though, that almost all window managers fail to implement this
feature.
<p>
 A workaround is to call setGeometry() after show(). This has the
 two disadvantages that the widget appears at a wrong place for a
 millisecond (results in flashing) and that currently only every
 second window manager gets it right. A safer solution is to store
 both pos() and size() and to restore the geometry using resize() and
 move() before calling show(), as demonstrated in the following
 example:
<p>
<pre>        MyWidget* widget = new MyWidget
        ...
        <a href="qpoint.html">QPoint</a> p = widget-&gt;pos();       // store position
        <a href="qsize.html">QSize</a> s = widget-&gt;size();       // store size
        ...
        widget = new MyWidget;
        widget-&gt;resize( s );    // restore size
        widget-&gt;move( p );      // restore position
        widget-&gt;show();         // show widget
</pre>
<p>
This method works on both MS-Windows and most existing X11 window
managers.
