<h1 align=center> Books about GUI</h1><br clear="all">
<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.
<p><b>Programming with Qt</b> by Kalle Dalheimer, ISBN 1-56592-588-2
is a simple introduction to programming with Qt.  For those wanting
something more than our short tutorial, this is it.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565925882/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>
<p><b>The Design of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.
<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example
chapter</a> on the author's web site.

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.

<p><b>The Microsoft Windows User Experience</b>, ISBN 1-55615-679-0,
is Microsoft's look and feel Bible.  Indispensable for everyone who
has customers that worship Microsoft, and it's quite good, too.

<p>Microsoft's guidelines are often available on the web, but have
occasionally been hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.

<p><b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
perhaps the only thorough coverage of icons and icon use in software.
In order for icons to be successful, people must be able to do four
things with them: decode, recognize, find and activate them.  This
book explains these goals from scratch and how to reach them, both
with single icons and icon families.  Some 500 examples are scattered
throughout the text, generally in groups of four or five.
