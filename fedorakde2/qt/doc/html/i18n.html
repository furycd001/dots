<h1 align=center> Internationalization with Qt</h1><br clear="all">
Internationalization of software is the process of allowing the
software to be used efficiently by all people of the world.  This
means adapting to user and locality preferences such as language,
input techniques, character encodings, and presentation conventions.
<p>
<h2>Step by Step</h2>
<p>
Writing cross-platform international software with Qt is a gentle,
incremental process.  Your software can become internationalized in
the following stages:
<p>
<ol>
 <li><b>Use QString for all user-visible text.</b>
        <p>
        Since QString uses the Unicode encoding internally, all the
        languages of the world can be processed transparently using
        familiar text processing operations.  Also, since all Qt
        functions that present text to the user take a QString as a
        parameter, there is no char* to QString conversion time.
        <p>
        Strings that are in "programmer space" (such as QObject names
        and file format texts) need not use QString; the traditional
        char* or the QCString class will suffice.
        <p>
        You're unlikely to notice that you are using Unicode -
        QString, and QChar are just like easier versions of the clumsy
        const char* and char from traditional C.
        </p>
 <li><b>Use <a href="qobject.html#2418a9">tr()</a> for all literal text.</b>
        <p>
        Where your program uses <tt>"quoted text"</tt> for text
        that will be presented to the user, ensure it goes through
        the <a href="qapplication.html#35f6de">QApplication::translate()</a> function, usually this
        simply means using <a href="qobject.html#2418a9">QObject::tr()</a>.
        For example, assuming <tt>LoginWidget</tt> is a subclass of
        QWidget:
        <pre>        LoginWidget::LoginWidget()
        {
            <a href="qlabel.html">QLabel</a> *label = new <a href="qlabel.html">QLabel</a>( tr("Password:"), this );
            ...
        }
</pre>
<p>
        This is 99% of the user-visible strings you're likely to
        write.
<p>
        If the quoted text is <em>not</em> in a member function of a
        QObject/QWidget subclass, use either the tr() function of an
        appropriate class, or the QApplication::translate() function
        directly:
        <pre>        void some_global_function( LoginWidget * logwid )
        {
            <a href="qlabel.html">QLabel</a> *label = new <a href="qlabel.html">QLabel</a>(
                    LoginWidget::tr("Password:"), logwid );
        }

        void same_global_function( LoginWidget * logwid )
        {
            <a href="qlabel.html">QLabel</a> *label = new <a href="qlabel.html">QLabel</a>(
                    qApp-&gt;translate("LoginWidget", "Password:"),
                    logwid );
        }
</pre>
<p>
        Finally, if you need to have translatable text completely
        outside a function, there are two macros to help: QT_TR_NOOP()
        and QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP().  They merely mark the text for
        extraction by the <tt>lupdate</tt> utility described below -
        the macros expand to just the text (without the scope).
        Example usages are shown below.
<p>
        <pre>        <a href="qstring.html">QString</a> FriendlyConversation::greeting( int greet_type )
        {
            static const char* greeting_strings[] = {
                QT_TR_NOOP( "Hello" ),
                QT_TR_NOOP( "Goodbye" )
            };
            return tr( greeting_strings[greet_type] );
        }

        static const char* greeting_strings[] = {
            QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP( "FriendlyConversation", "Hello" ),
            QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP( "FriendlyConversation", "Goodbye" )
        };
        <a href="qstring.html">QString</a> FriendlyConversation::greeting( int greet_type )
        {
            return tr( greeting_strings[greet_type] );
        }
</pre>
<p>
        If you disable the const char* to QString automatic conversion
        by compiling your software with the macro QT_NO_CAST_ASCII
        defined, you'll be very likely to catch any strings you are
        missing. See QString::fromLatin1() for more details. Disabling
        the conversion can make programming cumbersome.
        </p>
 <li><b>Use QString::arg() for simple arguments.</b>
        <p>
        The printf() style of inserting arguments in strings
        is a poor choice for internationalized text, as it is
        sometimes necessary to change the order of arguments when
        translating. The <a href="qstring.html#8bd12a">QString::arg()</a>
        functions offer a simple means for substituting arguments:
        <pre>        void FileCopier::showProgress( int done, int total,
                                       const QString&amp; current_file )
        {
            label.setText( tr("%1 of %2 files copied.\nCopying: %3")
                            .arg(done)
                            .arg(total)
                            .arg(current_file)
                         );
        }
</pre>
<p>
        </p>
 <li><b>Produce translation.</b>
<p>
        The following requires the Qt Linguist and it's tools.
        <tt>lupdate</tt> and <tt>lrelease</tt> are parts of this
        package.
        A prerelease version of the Linguist is available from
        <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/company/announce/linguistpre.html">
        http://www.trolltech.com/company/announce/linguistpre.html</a>.
<p>
        Once you are using tr() sufficiently, you can start producing
        translations of the user-visible text in your program.
<p>
        Translation of a Qt application is a three-step process:
<p>
        <ol>
          <li> Run <tt>lupdate</tt> to extract translatable text from
          the C++ source code of the Qt application, resulting in a
          message file for translators (a .ts file).  The utility
          recognizes the tr() construct described above and creates
          a certain number of .ts files (usually one per language).
          <li> Provide translations for the source texts in the .ts
          file, using Qt Linguist.  Since .ts files are in XML
          format, you can also edit them by hand.
          <li> Run <tt>lrelease</tt> to obtain a light-weight message
          file (a .qm file) from the .ts file, suitable only for end
          use.  You can see the .ts files as "source files", and .qm
          as "object files".  The translator edits the .ts files, but
          the users of your application only need the .qm files.  Both
          kinds of files are platform and locale independent.
        </ol>
<p>
        Typically, you will repeat these steps for every release of
        your application.  The <tt>lupdate</tt> utility does its best
        to reuse the translations from the previous release.
<p>
        Before you run <tt>lupdate</tt>, you should prepare a project
        file.  Here's an example project file (or .pro file):
<p>
<pre>
HEADERS         = funnydialog.h \
                  wackywidget.h \
SOURCES         = funnydialog.cpp \
                  main.cpp \
                  wackywidget.cpp
TRANSLATIONS    = superapp_dk.ts \
                  superapp_fi.ts \
                  superapp_no.ts \
                  superapp_se.ts
</pre>
<p>
        When you invoke <tt>lupdate</tt> or <tt>lrelease</tt>, you
        have to give the name of the project file as a command-line
        argument.
<p>
        In this example, four exotic languages are supported: Danish,
        Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish.  If you use tmake, you don't
        need an extra project file for lupdate; your tmake project
        file will do, if you add the TRANSLATIONS lines.
<p>
        In your application, you have to <a href="qtranslator.html#4053d1">QTranslator::load()</a>
        the translation files appropriate for the user's language, and
        to install them using <a href="qapplication.html#e8df5e">QApplication::installTranslator()</a>.
<p>
        If you have been using the old Qt tools (findtr, msg2qm and
        mergetr), you can use <tt>qm2ts</tt> to convert your old
        .qm files.
<p>
        To get started, you should read at least the first chapter of
        the translation tutorial.
<p>
        While these utilities offer a convenient way to create .qm
        files, any system that writes .qm files is sufficient.  You
        could make an application that adds translations to a
        QTranslator with QTranslator::insert() and then writes a .qm
        file with QTranslator::save().  This way the translations can
        come from any source you choose.
<p>
        Qt itself contains a small number of strings that will also
        need to be translated to the languages that you are
        targeting.  In the near future Qt will ship with translations
        for some languages.  We recommend that if you need to
        translate the Qt strings now, put the translations in separate
        .ts and .qm files.  This will simplify transition to the
        official Qt translations.
<p>
        </p>
 <li><b>Support encodings.</b>
        <p>
        The QTextCodec class and the facilities in QTextStream
        make it easy to support many input and
        output encodings for your users' data. When the application
        starts, the locale of the machine will determine the 8-bit
        encoding used when dealing with 8-bit data - such as for
        font selection, text display, 8-bit text I/O, and character input.
<p>
        The application may occasionally have need for encodings other
        than the default local 8-bit encoding.  For example, an application
        in a Cyrillic KOI8-R locale (the defacto-standard locale in Russia)
        might need to output Cyrillic in the ISO 8859-5 encoding. Code for
        this would be:
<p>
        <pre>        <a href="qstring.html">QString</a> string = ...; // Some Unicode text.

        <a href="qtextcodec.html">QTextCodec</a>* codec = QTextCodec::codecForName("ISO 8859-5");
        <a href="qcstring.html">QCString</a> encoded_string = codec-&gt;<a href="qtextcodec.html#ec806f">fromUnicode</a>(string);

        ...; // Use encoded_string in 8-bit operations
</pre>
<p>
        For converting Unicode to local 8-bit encodings,
        a shortcut is available: the
        <a href="qstring.html#85c213">local8Bit()</a> method of
        QString returns such 8-bit data.  Another useful shortcut
        is the <a href="qstring.html#011d3d">utf8()</a> method, which
        returns text in the 8-bit UTF-8 encoding - interesting in
        that it perfectly preserves Unicode information while looking
        like plain US-ASCII if the Unicode is wholly US-ASCII.
<p>
        For converting the other way, there are the
        <a href="qstring.html#9465e8">QString::fromUtf8()</a> and
        <a href="qstring.html#47169a">QString::fromLocal8Bit()</a>
        convenience functions, or the general code, demonstrated by
        this conversion from ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic to Unicode conversion:
<p>
        <pre>        <a href="qcstring.html">QCString</a> encoded_string = ...; // Some ISO 8859-5 encoded text.

        <a href="qtextcodec.html">QTextCodec</a>* codec = QTextCodec::codecForName("ISO 8859-5");
        <a href="qstring.html">QString</a> string = codec-&gt;<a href="qtextcodec.html#32c727">toUnicode</a>(encoded_string);

        ...; // Use string in all of Qt's QString operations.
</pre>
<p>
        Ideally Unicode I/O should be used as this maximizes the portability
        of documents between users around the world, but in reality
        it is useful to support all the appropriate encodings that
        your users' will need to process existing documents. In general,
        Unicode (UTF16 or UTF8) is the best for information transferred
        between arbitrary people, while within a language or national group,
        a local standard is often more appropriate.  The most important
        encoding to support is the one returned by
        <a href="qtextcodec.html#615e15">QTextCodec::codecForLocale()</a>,
        as this is the one the user is most likely to need for communicating
        with other people and applications (this is the codec used by
        local8Bit()).
<p>
        Since most Unix systems do not have built-in support for converting
        between local 8-bit encodings and Unicode, it may be necessary to
        write your own QTextCodec subclass. Depending on the urgency, it
        may be useful to contact Trolltech technical support or ask on
        the qt-interest mailing list to see if someone else is already working
        on supporting the encoding.  A useful interim measure can be to
        use the QTextCodec::loadCharmapFile() function to build a data-driven
        codec; this has a memory and speed penalty, especially with
        dynamically loaded libraries. For details of writing your own
        QTextCodec, see the mail QTextCodec class documentation.
<p>
        </p>
 <li><b>Localization.</b>
        <p>
        Localization is the process of adapting to local conventions
        such as date and time presentations.  Such localizations can be
        accomplished using appropriate tr() strings, even "magic" words,
        as this somewhat contrived example shows:
        <pre>        void Clock::setTime(const QTime&amp; t)
        {
            if ( tr("AMPM") == "AMPM" ) {
                // 12-hour clock
            } else {
                // 24-hour clock
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>
        </p>
<p>
        In general, it is recommended that you do <em>not</em> attempt
        to localize images - choose clear icons that are appropriate
        for all localities, rather than relying on local puns or
        stretched metaphors.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>System Support</h2>
<p>
Operating systems and window systems supporting Unicode are still in
the early stages of development.  The level of support
available in the underlying system influences the support Qt provides
on that platform, but applications written with Qt need not generally
be too concerned with the actual limitations.
<dl compact>
  <dt>Unix/X11
    <dd><ul>
     <li>Locale-oriented fonts and input methods.  Qt hides these and
            provides Unicode input and output.
     <li>Filesystem conventions such as
            <a class="r" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt">UTF-8</a>
            are under development
            in some Unix variants.  All Qt file functions allow Unicode,
            but convert all filenames to the local 8-bit encoding, as
            this is the Unix convention
            (see <a href="qfile.html#a34c1e">QFile::setEncodingFunction()</a>
             if you are interested in exploring alternative encodings).
     <li>File I/O defaults to the local 8-bit encoding,
            with Unicode options in QTextStream.
     </ul>
  <dt>Windows 95/98/NT
    <dd><ul>
     <li>Qt provides full Unicode support, including input methods, fonts,
          clipboard, drag-and-drop, and file names.
     <li>File I/O defaults to Latin-1, with Unicode options in QTextStream.
          Note that some Windows programs do not understand big-endian
          Unicode text files even though that is the order prescribed by
          the Unicode Standard in the absence of higher-level protocols.
     <li>Note that unlike programs written with MFC or plain winlib, Qt programs
          are portable between Windows 95/98 and Windows NT -
          <em>you do not need different binaries to support Unicode</em>.
    </ul>
</dl>
<p>
<h2>Supporting more Input Methods</h2>
<p>
While Trolltech doesn't have the resources or expertise in all the
languages of the world to immediately include support in Qt, we are
very keen to work with people who <em>do</em> have the expertise.
Over the next few minor version numbers, we hope to add support for
<em>your</em> language of choice, until everyone can use Qt and all
the programs developed with Qt, regardless of their language.
<p>
Initially, languages with uni-directional single-byte encodings
(European Latin-1 and KOI8-R, etc.)  and the uni-directional
multi-byte encodings (East Asian EUC-JP, etc.) will be supported.
Later, support for the "complex" encodings - those requiring
right-to-left input or complex character composition (eg. Arabic,
Hebrew, and Thai script) will be implemented.  The current state of
activity is:
<dl compact>
 <dt><b>All encodings on Windows</b>
    <dd>On Windows, the local encoding is always supported.
 <dt><b>ISO standard encodings
        ISO 8859-1,
        ISO 8859-2,
        ISO 8859-3,
        ISO 8859-4,
        ISO 8859-5,
        ISO 8859-7,
        ISO 8859-9, and
        ISO 8859-15
        </b>
  <dd>Fully supported.
        The Arabic (ISO 8859-6-I) and Hebrew (ISO 8859-8-I) encodings
        are not supported, but are under development externally.
 <dt><b>KOI8-R</b>
  <dd>Fully supported.
 <dt><b>eucJP, JIS, and ShiftJIS</b>
  <dd>Fully supported. Uses eucJP with the XIM protocol on X11,
        and the IME Windows NT in Japanese Windows NT.
        Serika Kurusugawa and other are assisting with this effort.
        <a href="ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/kinput2/">kinput2</a>
        is the tested input method for X11.
 <dt><b>eucKR</b>
  <dd>Under external development,
        Mizi Research are assisting with this effort.
        <a class="r" href="http://www.mizi.com">hanIM</a>
        is the tested input method.
 <dt><b>Big5</b>
  <dd>Qt contains a Big5 codec developed by Ming Che-Chuang.
        Testing is underway with the xcin (2.5.x) XIM server.
 <dt><b>eucTW</b>
  <dd>Under external development.
</dl>
<p>
If you are interested in contributing to existing efforts, or
supporting new encodings beyond the more standard ones above, your
work can be considered for inclusion in the official Qt distribution,
or just included with your application.
<p>
Eventually, we hope to help Unix become as Unicode-oriented as
Windows NT is becoming. This means better font support in the font servers,
with new developments like the True Type font servers
<a class="r" href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/programs/xfsft/">xfsft</a>,
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/">xfstt</a>,
and x-tt, as well as
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt">UTF-8</a>
(a Unicode encoding) filenames such as with the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/white-papers/wp-unicode/">Unicode
support in Solaris<sup class="tm"><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> 7</a>.
<p>
<h2>Notes about locales on X11</h2>
<p>
Many Unix distributions contain only partial support for some locales -
for example, if you have a <tt>/usr/share/locale/ja_JP.EUC</tt>
directory, this does not necessarily mean you can display Japanese text
- you also need JIS encoded fonts (or Unicode fonts), and that
<tt>/usr/share/locale/ja_JP.EUC</tt> directory needs to be complete.
For best results, use complete locales from your OS vendor.
