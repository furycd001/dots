<h1 align=center> Key Features in Qt 2.2</h1><br clear="all">
The greatest new feature in the 2.2 release is the Qt Designer, a
visual GUI design tool. It makes it possible to cut down on
development time even further through WYSIWYG dialog design. The
designer makes use of improved runtime flexibility and a revised
property system. Please see <a href="designer.html">Qt GUI Designer</a> for a feature overview.
<p>
Qt 2.2 integrates now fully on MS-Windows 2000.  This includes fade
and scroll effects for popup windows and titelbar gradients for MDI
document windows in the MDI module. As with all Qt features, we
provide the same visual effects on Unix/X11. Try adding this to
your <tt>~/.Xresources</tt> or <tt>~/.Xdefaults</tt> file:
<pre>
   ! Qt GUI effects
   *guieffects: fademenu animatecombo animatetooltip
   designer.guieffects: animatemenu fadetooltip
</pre>
<p>
Two new classes QAction
and QActionGroup
make it much easier to
create sophisticated main windows for today's applications. A QAction
abstracts a user interface action that can appear both in menus and
tool bars.  An action group makes it easier to deal with groups of
actions. It allows to add, remove or activate its children with a
single call and provides "one of many" semantics for toggle
actions. Changing an action's properties, for example using
setEnabled(), setOn() or setText(), immediately shows up in all
representations.
<p>
Few people consider the original OSF Motif style the most elegant or
flashy GUI style. Therefore several attempts have been made to come up
with a slightly improved Motif-ish look and feel. One of them is the
thinner CDE style, which was supported by Qt since version 2.0.  In the
2.2 release, we now added support for SGI's very own Motif version on
IRIX workstations.  With its more elegant bevelling of 3D elements and
mouse-under highlight effects, it is quite appealing. For Linux users,
we added a motif plus style, that resembles the bevelling used by the
GIMP toolkit (GTK). Optionally, this style also does hovering
highlight on buttons.
<p>
Last but not least we added support for multithreaded
applications. The classes involved are QThread to start threads,
QMutex and QSemaphore to serialize them, QWaitCondition to wait/wake
threads on conditions. See the <a href="threads.html">Threads
documentation</a> for more details.
<p>
In addition to improving the fundamental Qt functionality,
we've made changes regarding distribution. In order to
address the steady growth of functionality in the Qt library, we
split the source code into distinct modules that can be compiled
in (or left out) separately. This also makes it possible for us to
keep the cost of entry into the commercial Qt world as low as possible.
<p>
The modules available in Qt 2.2 are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Tools:</b> platform-independent Non-GUI API for I/O, encodings, containers,
    strings, time & date, and regular expressions.
<li> <b>Kernel:</b> platform-independent GUI API, a complete window-system API.
<li> <b>Widgets:</b> portable GUI controls.
<li> <b>Dialogs:</b> ready-made common dialogs for selection of colors, files,
    printers, fonts, and basic types, plus a wizard framework, message
    boxes and progress indicator.
<li> <b><a href="opengl.html">OpenGL 3D Graphics:</a></b>
    integration of OpenGL with Qt, making it very
    easy to use OpenGL rendering in a Qt application.
<li> <b><a href="network.html">Network:</a></b>
    advanced socket and server-socket handling plus
    asynchronous DNS lookup.
<li> <b><a href="canvas.html">Canvas:</a></b>
    a highly optimized 2D graphic area.
<li> <b><a href="table.html">Table:</a></b>
    a flexible and editable table widget.
<li> <b><a href="iconview.html">IconView:</a></b>
    a powerful visualization widget similar to QListView and
    QListBox. It contains optinally labelled pixmap items that the user
    can select, drag around, rename, delete and more.
<li> <b>XML:</b>
    a well-formed XML parser with SAX interface plus an
    implementation of the DOM Level 1.
<li> <b><a href="workspace.html">Workspace:</a></b>
    a workspace window that can contain decorated document
    windows for Multi Document Interfaces (MDI).
</ul>
