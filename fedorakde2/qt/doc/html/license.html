2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided
   that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright,
   trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer
   of the Software, is distributed.

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
     a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in
        the Software.
<p>
     b. When modifications to the Software are released under this
        license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
        initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification
        in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain
        available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of

<blockquote>
<p>
     a. You must include this license document in the distribution.
<p>
     b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms
        are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code
        to the distributed Software, including all modifications, without
        any charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent
        notices in the distribution explaining this.
<p>
     c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
        machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
        license.
<p>
</blockquote>
<p>
5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
   compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you
   or by others.
<p>
6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
   software items that link with the original or modified versions of the
   Software.  These items, when distributed, are subject to the following
   requirements:
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
     a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of
        these items are also able to receive and use the complete
        machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
        beyond the costs of data transfer.
<p>
     b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
        and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
        both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must
        be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
        able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
<p>
     c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
        initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
        then you must supply one.
<p>
