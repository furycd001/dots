<h1 align=center> Licenses for Code Used in Qt</h1><br clear="all">
Qt contains a little code that is not under the
<a href="license.html">QPL</a>,
the <a href=gpl.html>GPL</a>,
or the Qt Commercial License Agreement, but rather
under specific highly permissive license from the original authors.
This page lists the licenses used for that code, names the authors,
and links to the points where it is used.
<p>
Trolltech gratefully acknowledges these and others contribution to
Qt.  We recommend that all programs that use Qt also acknowledge these
contributions, and quote all these license statements in an appendix
to the documentation.
