<h1 align=center> Properties</h1><br clear="all">
Qt provides a sophisticated property system similar to those shipped
by some compiler vendors. However, as a compiler- and
platform-independent library, Qt cannot rely on non-standard compiler
features like <code>__property</code> or <code>[property].</code> Our solution works with
any standard C++ compiler on every platform we support. It's based on
the <a href="metaobjects.html">Meta Object System</a> that also
provides object communication through signals and slots.
<p>
The <code>Q_PROPERTY</code> macro in a class declaration declares a
property. Properties can only be declared in classes that inherit <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a>. A second macro - <code>Q_OVERRIDE</code> - can be used to override some
aspects of an inherited property in a subclass.
<p>
To the outer world, a property appears quite similar to a data
member. However, properties have several features that distinguish
them from ordinary data members:
<p>
<ul>
<li> a read method.  This always exists.
<li> a write method.  Optional: read-only properties like <a href="qwidget.html#38c72f">QWidget::isDesktop()</a> do not have this.
<li> an attribute "stored" that indicates persistence.  Most
properties are stored, but a few janus-faced properties like <a href="qwidget.html#3dae47">QWidget::minimumWidth()</a> aren't: That property is just way of looking
at <a href="qwidget.html#b24d94">QWidget::minimumSize()</a>, it has no data of its own.
<li> a reset method to set a property back to its context specific
default value.  Very unusual, but e.g. <a href="qwidget.html#167922">QWidget::font()</a> needs it:
The default is to follow its surroundings, and no call to <a href="qwidget.html#090d60">QWidget::setFont()</a> can mean that.
<li> an attribute "designable" that indicates whether a property is
considered to be designable in a GUI Designer.  Most are, but e.g. <a href="qbutton.html#ea8b93">QButton::isDown()</a> can't be designed.  The user can press buttons, and
the application programmer can make the program press its own buttons,
but a GUI design tool can't press buttons.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Properties can be read and written through generic functions in
QObject without knowing anything about class in use.  These two are
equivalent:
<p>
<pre>    //QButton * b and QObject * o point to the same button
    b-&gt;setDown( TRUE );
    o-&gt;setProperty( "down", TRUE );
</pre>
<p>
Equivalent, that is, except that the first is faster, and that the
first gives much better diagnostics at compile time.  When accessible,
the first is preferred.  However, since you can get a list of all
available properties for any QObject through its <a href="qmetaobject.html">metaObject()</a> setProperty() can give you control over classes
that weren't available at compile time.
<p>
As well as QObject::setProperty(), there is a <a href="qobject.html#a110be">QObject::property()</a>.
<a href="qmetaobject.html#8c9b9c">QMetaObject::propertyNames()</a> returns the names of all available
properties.  <a href="qmetaobject.html#843ead">QMetaObject::property()</a> returns the property data for
a named property: a <a href="qmetaproperty.html">QMetaProperty</a> object.
<p>
Here's a simple example that shows the most important property
functions in use:
<p>
<pre>    class MyClass : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT
    public:
        MyClass( <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a> * parent=0, const char * name=0 );
        ~MyClass();

        enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
        void setPriority( Priority );
        Priority priority() const;
    };
</pre>
<p>
The class has a property "priority" that is not yet known to the meta
object system. In order to make the property known, you have to
declare it with the <code>Q_PROPERTY</code> macro. The syntax is as follows:
<p>
<pre>Q_PROPERTY( type name READ getFunction [WRITE setFunction]
            [STORED bool] [DESIGNABLE bool] [RESET resetFunction])
</pre>
<p>
For the declaration to be valid, the get function has to be const and
to return either the type itself, a pointer to it, or a reference to
it. The optional write function has to return void and to take exactly
one argument, either the type itself, a pointer or a const reference
to it. The meta object compiler enforces this.
<p>
The type of a property can be everything <a href="qvariant.html">QVariant</a> provides or an
enumeration type declared in the class itself. Since <code>MyClass</code> uses
the enumeration type <code>Priority</code> for the property, this type has to be
registered with the property system as well. This way it will be
possible to set a value by name, like this:
<p>
<pre>   obj-&gt;setProperty( "priority", "VeryHigh" );
</pre>
<p>
Enumeration types are registered with the <code>Q_ENUMS</code> macro.  Here's the
final class declaration including the property declaration:
<p>
<pre>    class MyClass : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_PROPERTY( Priority priority READ priority WRITE setPriority )
        Q_ENUMS( Priority )
    public:
        MyClass( <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a> * parent=0, const char * name=0 );
        ~MyClass();

        enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
        void setPriority( Priority );
        Priority priority() const;
    };
</pre>
<p>
Another similar macro is <code>Q_SETS.</code> Like <code>Q_ENUMS,</code> it registers an
enumeration type but marks it in addition as "set", i.e. the
enumeration values can be or'ed together.  An I/O class might have
enumeration values "Read" and "Write" and accept "Read|Write": Such an
enum is best handled with <code>Q_SETS,</code> not <code>Q_ENUMS.</code>
<p>
The remaining keywords in the <code>Q_PROPERTY</code> section are <code>STORED,</code> <code>DESIGNABLE</code> and <code>RESET.</code>
<p>
<code>STORED</code> declares whether the property's value is stored in the
object. Stored makes only sense for writable properties. The default
value is <code>true.</code>
<p>
<code>DESIGNABLE</code> declares whether this property is suited for
modification by a GUI designer program.  The default is <code>true</code> for
writable properties, otherwise <code>false.</code>
<p>
<code>RESET</code> names a function that will set the property to its default
state (which may have changed since initialization).  The function
must return void and take no arguments.
