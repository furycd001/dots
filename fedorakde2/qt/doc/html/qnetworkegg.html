<h1 align="center">The Twelve Networking Truths</h1>
<p>This is <a href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/1/in-notes/rfc">RFC
1925</a> - copied in here since its truths are even less limited than
the author says.  5, 6, 6a and 7 in particular can often be quoted
during software development discussions.

<h3>Status of this Memo</h3>
<p>
   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.
<p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
   This memo documents the fundamental truths of networking for the
   Internet community. This memo does not specify a standard, except in
   the sense that all standards must implicitly follow the fundamental
   truths.
<p>
<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>
   The truths described in this memo result from extensive study over an
   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not intend
   to contribute to this work. The editor merely has collected these
   truths, and would like to thank the networking community for
   originally illuminating these truths.
<p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   fundamental truths underlying all networking. These truths apply to
   networking in general, and are not limited to TCP/IP, the Internet,
   or any other subset of the networking community.
<p>
<h3>2. The Fundamental Truths</h3>
<p>
   <ol>
   <li> It Has To Work.
<li> No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
        you can't increase the speed of light.
<p>
        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you
        can't make a baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed
        this up <em>might</em> make it slower, but it won't make it
        happen any quicker. </ol>
<li> With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
        as they fly overhead.
<li> Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.
<li> It is always possible to agglutinate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.
<li> It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
        the problem to a different part of the overall network
        architecture) than it is to solve it.
<p>
        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). It is always possible to add
        another level of indirection. </ol>
<li> It is always something.
<p>
        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two
        (you can't have all three). </ol>
<li> It is more complicated than you think.
<li> For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.
<p>
       <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary) Every networking problem always
       takes longer to solve than it seems like it should.</ol>
<li> One size never fits all.
<li> Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
        a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.
<p>
        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). See rule 6a. </ol>
<li> In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
        away.
<p>
   </ol>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>
<p>
   This RFC raises no security issues. However, security protocols are
   subject to the fundamental networking truths.
