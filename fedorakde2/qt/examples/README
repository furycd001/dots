  painting without any world transform matrix or other advanced
  features.  Run the program, click the button, move the mouse,
  release the button, and watch the lines get drawn.

  This example continuously draws rectangles in a window and
  has another widget that counts the number of rectangles that
  are drawn per second.

- hello

  lots of icon items. It supports Drag'n'Drop, different selection modes,
  view modes, rubberband selection, etc.

  and it is displayed in the edit widget at the right transformed using
  the rot13 algorithm.

- scrollview
  This example shows how to use Qt's Scrollview.  This is a widget
  which can contain a very large contents and is very optimized for

  multiple child items and using the Splitter the user can decide
  herself/himself, how much space each child should get.

  When starting it you have to specify a filename as first argument.
  The dialog shows then infos about that file seperated into some tabs.

- table
  The table program displays a spreadsheet-like table.  It is an example
  of how to inherit the QScrollView widget for presentations of 2D data
  arrays.

  Left-click the mouse to set a current cell.  Press the arrow buttons to
  move the current mark around.  Type something to edit a cell's contents.

- themes
