The overlay example

This example program shows how to use OpenGL overlays with Qt OpenGL
Extension. Contains a QGLWidget with a relatively expensive redrawing
operation, and rubber-band drawing in the overlay plane. Using the
overlay has the advantage that the rubber-band may be drawn and erased
without damaging the image in the main plane, so costly redraws are
avoided.
