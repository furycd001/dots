Welcome to the "Programming OpenGL for the X Window System" Xlib-based
example source code.  The following table names each example program
directory and what section of the book discusses the example.

Section        Example directory
----------     ------------------
  1.5            glxsimple
  2.1            glxdino
  2.2.2          glxvisuals
  2.6.1          pixmap2eps
  6.2.3.1        xdevices
  6.2.7          dials
  6.3.4          sovinfo
  6.3.5          layerdemo

I've tried to make the Makefiles as simple and as portable as
possible.  If you find problems with these examples, please report bugs
to mjk@sgi.com
