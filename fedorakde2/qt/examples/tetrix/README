This code was written to test the very first Qt skeleton. It was in
fact the first Qt application and was written at a time when Qt only
had pushbutton widgets and the drawing engine was limited to drawing
text in a single font and drawing lines (no kidding, those were the
only two drawing operations). In fact the tetrix project doubled the
number of widgets in Qt by introducing the QLCDNumber widget. The whole
application was written in 5 evenings and 1 weekend and is not very
well documented. The tetrix engine is implemented in the GenericTetrix
class and was first made on my good old 10 MHZ AT where I made a DOS
text-mode Tetrix (using about 50 lines) to test it out, it was later
moved to a SUN Sparc 10, where it met Qt. GenericTetrix is totally
independent of Qt, feel free to use it in any way you like. (see the
file gtetrix.h for a brief description of how to use it) 

Enjoy!

P.S. Tetrix has later been updated to show new versions of Qt.

P.P.S The tetrix program uses a special application object called
      QDragApplication. Try to guess what it does.
      Hint: Try pressing the right mouse button somewhere in the
            tetrix window and start dragging....
