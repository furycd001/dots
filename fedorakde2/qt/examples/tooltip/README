The tooltip example demonstrates advanced use of tool tips.

There are dynamic tool tips on the blue rectanges - QToolTip asks
tooltip whether to display anything, and if so, what.  The Right Thing
happens when you click on the rectangles.

There is also a static tool tip on the red rectangle.  (That's the one
which isn't blue.)
