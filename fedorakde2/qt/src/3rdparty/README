The libraries included here are the original packages, unpacked, and
with their version number removed from the directory name (for version
information, see the README files in the directories).  The following
have been removed:
 
    libpng/contrib - a collection of examples and test-suite
    zlib/contrib - a collection of non-zlib code
    zlib/msdos   - Zlib for a platform never supported by Qt ;-)

Some patches are applied from time to time.

Qt applications assume that these libraries exist, and Qt cannot be
compiled unless these libraries are installed on the system.
