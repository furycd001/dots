Critical
--------


Severe
------

static usage of QFileDialog on Borland (Win32)
    API-call doesn't seem to work, so use Qt dialog as workaround

QApplication::widgetAt (Win32)
    This function does not work as expected (support/arc-07/14942 ff.)

drawText() on a printer (Win32)
    Text produces garbage (Win98) and is not scaled correctly (support/arc-07/15339).

copy/paste is reported not to work for custom formats (Win32)
    Posts on qt-interest suggest that drag&drop works correctly but not
    copy/paste through the clipboard.

QSpinbox
    does only do a interpreteText() on focus out. When a dialog has a spinbox
    and the focus is in it and the dialog is closed the text is not interpreted.

Small
-----

QPopupMenu
    Fix updateItem() (qt-bugs/arc-06/13748).

Dual Monitor support (Win32)
    TLW-Widgets with WType_Popup appear on main-screen.


Cosmetic
--------

QProgressBar
    Avoid flickering.
    This means caching both the percentage value (which is already done)
    and the pixel position (which has not been done yet).

QPrintDialog
    Try making it fit in a 640x480 display.
