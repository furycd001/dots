\title Qt GUI Designer

The Qt Designer is a visual design tool that makes designing and
implementing user interfaces a lot easier.

<center><a href="designer/book1.html"><img src="designer.png" alt="Screenshot of the Qt Designer"></a></center>

Here's a brief overview of its key features. For further information,
please browse the \link designer/book1.html online manual \endlink or
start the designer with \c designer and select \e Manual from the \e
Help menu.

<h3>Dynamic geometry management for full i18n and cross-platform support</h3>

  The designer offers all the strength of the Qt layout system with a
  a well-designed point and click interface. Geometry management makes
  an application adjust automatically to language changes, different
  GUI styles on different target platforms and different desktop
  settings like font sizes.

<h3>Visual access to Qt's signal/slot mechanism</h3>

 In the designer, you can connect signals to slots by dragging a line
  with the connection tool.

<h3>Internationalization (I18n)</h3>

 In its output, the designer quotes user strings with a
  tr-macro. Thus it works well together with Qt's built-in or any
  other i18n system.

<h3>Custom widgets</h3>

 Qt Designer supports custom controls. You add your own widgets with
  <em>Tools->Custom->Edit Custom Widgets</em>

<h3>Nested widgets/layouts</h3>

 Both widgets and layouts can be nested in a hierarchy, just like in
  hand-crafted Qt code.

<h3>Unlimited undo and redo</h3>

 The unlimited undo and redo system makes it simple to try different
  arrangements of the widgets until the result satisfies you.

<h3>Convenient editing of all widget properties</h3>

 Qt Designer uses a generic and very powerful property editor for
  most widget properties. Special editors for some widgets (like
  listboxes or comboboxes) allow you to fill these widgets with
  content without writing extra code.

<h3>Direct tabfocus editing</h3>

 A graphical tab-order tool makes it possible to edit the tabfocus
  chain intuitively with point and click.

<h3>Ensures unique keyboard accellerators</h3>

  Qt Designer checks that your keyboard shortcuts don't clash.

<h3>XML format</h3>

 The designer's native file format (*.ui files) is a well-defined true
  XML format.

<h3>Clean extensibility through subclassing</h3>

 No need to modify generated code. If you need extended functionality
  inside a generated dialog, you can easily do this by subclassing.

<h3>User Interface Compiler (uic) integrates into your build system</h3>

 No need to add generated code to the source repository of your
  version control system. With Qt Designer, you only deal with ui
  files. The uic compiler will then integrate the necessary C++ code
  on the fly during compile time.

<h3>Works together with emacs and Visual Studio (tm)</h3>

 Qt Designer is a visual dialog designer, not an integrated
  development environment. For writing code, use whatever environment
  you prefer. If you use emacs or Visual Studio (tm), we provide
  tighter integration with an elisp file or plugin respectively.

<h3>Searchable and indexed documentation and help system, includes the
  Qt API reference</h3>

 Hit <b>F1</b> and you get a help browser with useful index and search
  capabilities (click on the question mark). Try it yourself, it's much
  faster than using a traditional web browser on the Qt Reference
  documentation.
