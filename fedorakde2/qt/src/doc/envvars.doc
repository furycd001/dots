\title Qt/Embedded environment variables

<p>
QWS_SW_CURSOR
If defined, always use a software mouse cursor even when using an accelerated
driver that supports a hardware cursor

<p>
QWS_DISPLAY
Defines display type and framebuffer - e.g.
Voodoo3
Mach64:/dev/fb1
Defaults to unaccelerated Linux framebuffer driver on /dev/fb0.
Valid drivers are QVfb, VGA16, LinuxFb (unaccelerated Linux framebuffer),
Mach64 (accelerated for ATI Mach64 cards such as the Rage Pro),
Voodoo3 (accelerated for the 3dfx Voodoo 3, should also work on Voodoo
Banshee), Matrox (should work on all Matrox graphics cards since the
Matrox Millennium), Transformed(for rotated displays), SVGALIB and
VNC. Transformed displays have a special format - within the specification
should be a multiple of 90 degrees rotation specified as Rot<x>,
for instance Transformed:Rot90.

<p>
QTDIR
If defined tells Qt/Embedded to where to find its fonts - fontdir
should be in $QTDIR/etc/fonts/. If undefined it's assumed to be
/usr/local/qt-embedded

<p>
QWS_SIZE
If defined forces Qt/Embedded into a window of <width>x<height> size centred 
within the screen, e.g. 320x200

<p>
QWS_NOMTRR
If defined, don't use Memory Type Range Registers to define the framebuffer
as write-combined on x86. Write-combining speeds up graphics output.

<p>
QWS_CARD_SLOT
Tells the accelerated drivers which card to attempt to accelerate.
This should be a path in /proc/bus/pci. It defaults to
/proc/bus/pci/01/00.0 - the first device on the second PCI bus in the
system, which is normally the AGP card.

<p>
QWS_USB_KEYBOARD
If defined, instead of opening /dev/tty open the USB low-level event
device defined in QWS_USB_KEYBOARD (e.g. /dev/input/event0) - this
is useful if you wish to run X and Qt/Embedded side by side on
different framebuffers.

<p>
QWS_MOUSE_PROTO
Defined as <type>:<device>, e.g. Microsoft:/dev/ttyS0. If you want to
use a USB mouse directly (separate from X) use MouseMan:/dev/input/mouse0
or similar. Valid mouse protocls are Auto (automatically sense protocol),
MouseMan, IntelliMouse, Microsoft, QVfbMouse (only useful with QVfb)
and TPanel, a sample touch panel driver.

<p>
QWS_KEYBOARD
Defines the keyboard type. Multiple keyboards can be handled at once,
input will be read from all of them. Valid values:
Buttons (an iPaq button device if QT_QWS_IPAQ is compiled, otherwise
one for the Cassiopeia), QVfbKeyboard (only useful with QVfb),
and TTY (either a USB keyboard or /dev/tty depending if QWS_USB_KEYBOARD
is defined)
