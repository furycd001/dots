\title Installation

<p>
The installation procedure is different for the different Qt platforms:

<ul>
 <li><a href=install-x11.html>Qt/X11</a>
 <li><a href=install-win.html>Qt/Windows</a>
 <li><a href=install-qws.html>Qt/Embedded</a>
</ul>
*/

/*! \page install-x11.html

\title Installing Qt/X11

<p>
You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
where you choose to install Qt.

<ul>
<li>Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

<pre>
	cd /usr/local
	gunzip qt-x11-<i>version</i>.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-x11-<i>version</i>.tar	# unpack it
</pre>

<p>
    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-<i>version</i> containing the
    files from the main archive.
<p>
    Rename qt-<i>version</i> to qt (or make a symlink):
<pre>
	mv qt-<i>version</i> qt
</pre>
    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.
</p>
<li>Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. (Create the
    file if it is not there already.)

<table>
	<tr><td>QTDIR		   <td> wherever you installed Qt
	<tr><td>PATH		   <td> to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	<tr><td>MANPATH 	   <td> to access the Qt man pages
	<tr><td>LD_LIBRARY_PATH	   <td> for the shared Qt library
	<tr><td>QT_FONTPATH	   <td> optional. A list of directories where Qt can find type1 or true type fonts for
					print embedding. 
</table>

<p>
    This is done like this:

<p>
    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:
<pre>
	QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QTDIR/man:$MANPATH
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

<pre>
	setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/man:$MANPATH
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

<p>
    If you have some true type or type1 fonts installed in non
    standard places, you might want to set the QT_FONTPATH environment
    variable to point to these directories. This is not needed, when
    all fonts are accessed through local font directories or a local
    font server, as Qt will automatically scan the fontpath and the
    font servers configuration file. All directories in the fontpath
    will need to have a valid fonts.dir file, so Qt can map from X11
    font names to the corresponding embeddable font.
</p>

<p>
    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $QTDIR
    is set.  The installation will give an error message and not
    proceed otherwise.
</p>

<li> Install your license file.  For the free edition, you do not need
    a license file.  For Professional and Enterprise editions, install
    your license file as described in your distribution.
</p>

<li> Building.
<p>
    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (eg. the Designer).
<p>
    Type:
<pre>
	./configure
</pre>
<p>
    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.
<p>
    To create the library and compile all examples and the tutorial:
<pre>
	make
</pre>
    If your platform or compiler is not supported, read PORTING.  If it is
    supported but you have problems, see <a href=http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/>http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/</a>
</p>

<li> In very few cases you may need to run /sbin/ldconfig or something
    similar at this point if you are using shared libraries.
<p>
    If you have problems running the example programs, e.g. messages like
<pre>
	 can't load library 'libqt.so.2'
</pre>
    you probably need to put a reference to the qt library in a
    configuration file and run /sbin/ldconfig as root on your system.
    And don't forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as explained in 2) above.
</p>

<li> The online HTML documentation is installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/html/
    The main page is /usr/local/qt/doc/html/index.html
    The man pages are installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/man/
</p>
</ul>

<p>
You're done.  Qt is now installed.

*/

/*! \page install-win.html

\title Installing Qt/Windows

The Qt/Windows distribution is distributed as a self-extracting archive
with a built-in installer. Just follow the installation wizard.
<p>
Once installed, you may want to unpack alternative makefile sets which
are packaged in the <tt>mkfiles</tt> directory - unpack them directly
into you Qt directory, overwriting previous makefiles.
