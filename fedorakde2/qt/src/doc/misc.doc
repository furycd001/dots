\title About Qt

<p>Qt is a cross-platform C++ GUI application framework. It provides
application developers with all the functionality needed to build
state-of-the-art graphical user interfaces. Qt is fully
object-oriented, easily extensible, and allows true component
programming.

<p>
Since its commercial introduction in early
1996, Qt has formed the basis of many thousands of successful
applications worldwide. Qt is also the basis of the popular
<a class="r" href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> Linux
desktop environment, a standard component of all major Linux distributions.

<p>
Qt is supported on the following platforms:
<ul>
 <li><b>MS/Windows</b> - 95, 98, NT, and 2000
 <li><b>Unix/X11</b> - Linux, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Digital Unix,
	    IBM AIX, SGI IRIX and a wide range of others
 <li><b>Embedded</b> - Linux platforms with framebuffer support.
</ul>

<p>
Qt is a product of <a href="troll.html">Trolltech</a>.

<p>
Qt is released in different editions:

<dl>
<dd><b>Qt Enterprise Edition</b> and <b>Qt Professional Edition</b>
provide for commercial software development.
They permits traditional commercial software
distribution and includes free upgrades and Technical Support
Service. For the latest prices, please see the Trolltech web site, <a
href="http://www.trolltech.com/pricing.html">Pricing and Availability</a>
page, or contact <a href="mailto:sales@trolltech.com">sales@trolltech.com</a>.
The Enterprise Edition offers \link modules.html extended modules
\endlink over the Professional Edition.

<dd><b>Qt Free Edition</b> is the Unix/X11 version of Qt
available for development of <em>Free and Open Source software</em>
only. It is provided free of charge under the terms of both the
<a href="license.html">Q Public License</a> and the
<a href="gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
The latest version is available for

\title Common Problems

<h2>Link error, complaining about a lack of \c vtbl, \c _vtbl, \c
__vtbl or similar </h2>

This indicates that you include the Q_OBJECT macro in a class declaration
and probably also run the moc, but forget to link the moc-generated object
code into your executable. Read <a href="moc.html">Using the Meta Object
Compiler</a> for details on how to use moc.

<h2>Using different versions of Qt on the same machine</h2>

Qt programs need the following components of the Qt distribution: <dl>

<dt><b>Header files - Compile time</b>

<dd>Programmers need to include the Qt header files. Those with a
command-line compiler will typically use options such as \c
/I%QTDIR%\include or \c -I${QTDIR}/include.  They will need the header
files of the version of Qt they wish to build programs with.  The
header files are in the \c include subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<dt><b>Meta Object Compiler - Compile time</b>

<dd>Programmers need to run the Meta Object Compiler - \e moc.  The moc is
found in the \c bin subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<dt><b>Static or shared libraries - Link time</b>

<dd>Programmers need to link with static or shared libraries. Those with a
command-line compiler will typically use options such as \c
/L%QTDIR%\lib\qt.lib or \c -L${QTDIR}/lib \c -lqt.  They will need the
libraries of the version of Qt they wish to build programs with.  The
libraries are in the \c lib subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<dt><b>Shared libraries - Run time</b>

<dd>Users of programs built with the shared Qt libraries need these same
shared libraries to run the programs.  The libraries are in the \c lib
subdirectory of Qt distributions.  Shared libraries are made available
to programs in places such as \c C:\windows\system on Windows
platforms, directories listed in file \c /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux,
standard \c lib directories on Unix, or the directories listed in the
environment variable \c ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} on Unix/Linux.

</dl>

Binary packages usually consist of two parts:

<ul>
<li>run time libraries in the run time package, usually called
\c qt2.

<li>header files, the moc and static libraries in the developers' kit,
usually called \c qt2-dev.

</ul>

Depending on how you are using Qt, you need to make specific parts of
the Qt distribution available to your programs.  Typical situations are
described below.<dl>

<dt><b>Developers building for a single version of Qt on Unix
- Qt packages</b>

<dd>You build programs with a single version of Qt, but you still need
to run programs linked with another version of Qt.  You are typically
a Linux developer who builds programs for Qt 2.x on a KDE desktop based
on Qt 1.4x.  Qt packages are usually split into a shared library
package with a name like \c qt and a developer package with a name
like \c qt-dev.  You will need the appropriate packages:

<ul>

<li>To build programs you will need the header files, the moc and the
libraries of Qt 2.x. They are included in the developer package of
Qt 2.x (\c qt2-dev or the like).

<li>To run programs you will need the shared libraries of Qt 2.x
and Qt 1.4x. They are included in the regular packages
of Qt 2.x (\c qt2 or the like) and Qt 1.4x (\c qt1
or the like).

</ul>Just install those 3 packages. You may need to set the
environment variable \c QTDIR.

<dt><b>Developers building for two versions of Qt on Unix
- Qt sources</b>

<dd>You build and run programs for Qt v1.4x and Qt 2.x. You will need:<ul>

<li>the \e header \e files, the \e moc and the \e libraries of Qt 2.x
and Qt 1.4x to build programs,

<li>the shared libraries of Qt 2.x and Qt 1.4x to run programs (if you
use shared linking).

</ul>

Get source distributions of both Qt 1.4x and Qt 2.x. <ol>

<li>Install and build Qt 1.4x and Qt 2.x, usually in \c /opt or
\c /usr/local. In the case of \c /opt:

\code
$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-1.44.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-1.44
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-1.44
$ configure [options]
$ make

$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-2.1.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-2.1.0
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.1.0
$ configure [options]
$ make
\endcode

<li>Make shared libraries available to programs at run time. Either
add both \c /opt/qt-1.44 and \c /opt/qt-2.0.1 to your environment
variable \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH or make links to the libraries in a
standard directory like \c /usr/local/lib:

\code
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s /opt/qt-1.44/lib/libqt.so.1 .
ln -s /opt/qt-2.1.0/lib/libqt.so.2 .
\endcode

</ol>

To develop with Qt 1.4x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-1.44
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

To develop with Qt 2.x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.1.0
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

Setting the \c PATH ensures that the proper version of moc is being
used.  Your \c Makefile should refer to \c ${QTDIR}/include and \c
${QTDIR}/lib to include the proper header files and link with the
proper libraries.

</dl>

<h2>Using Qt on X11 without a window manager</h2>

When using Qt without a window manager on Unix/X11, you will very
likely experience focus problems. Without a window manager, there is
no focus handling on X11, and no concept of an active window
either. If you want your application to work in such an environment,
you have to explicitly mark a window as active \e after showing it:

\code
 yourWindow->show();
 yourWindow->setActiveWindow();
\endcode

Note that setActiveWindow() won't work if the widget does not become
physically visible during this event cycle. However, without a window
manager running, this is guaranteed to happen. For the curious reader:
setActiveWindow() emulates a window manager by explicitly setting the
X Input Focus to a widget's toplevel window.

Other common problems are covered by the online

\title Key Features in Qt 2.1

As usual, large sections of the documentation have been revised and
lots of new documentation has been added.

<p>Much work went into existing classes, based on all the feedback we got
from our users.  A warm thank you to you all at this point, we
honestly hope to satisfy most of your wishes with the new release.

<p>Among the things that got a lot of polishing is the new geometry
management system that was introduced with the 2.x series.  Some
classes, such as QBoxLayout, have been rewritten and many size hints
and size policies were optimized.  As usual with newly introduced
systems, the occasional bug has been fixed as well.  As a result,
layout in Qt-2.1 is not only nicer but also faster.

<p>Big parts of the file dialog have been rewritten.  It is now
synchronized in terms of features with the common Windows dialog,
including fancy drag'n'drop and in-place renaming.  You can customize
both parts of the dialog, the front-end with info and preview widgets,
the back-end with different network protocols (see the QFileDialog and
QNetworkProtocol documentation for details).

<p>Especially interesting for dynamic Qt applications is the newly
introduced property system.  Many interesting things, from scripting
up to graphical user interface builders, become easier.  The
technology requires a new macro Q_PROPERTY and a new revision of Qt's
meta object compiler (moc).  See the Qt documentation for details.

<p>Due to strong customer demand, we added a cross-platform way to easily
implement multi-document interfaces (known as 'MDI').  The widget is
called QWorkspace and makes this task trivial.

<p>On X11, text dropping from Motif drag'n'drop applications has been
added, to make your Qt applications inter-operable with those Motif
applications that survived Y2K.

<p>The rich text system, first introduced in Qt 2.0, has been revised.
Apart from great speed improvements, it now supports HTML tables as
well as floating images.

<p>QMultiLineEdit, the text input field in Qt, got the missing word wrap
functionality.  It's probably the last big extension we will add to
that widget.  In Qt 3.0, it will be replaced by a fancier, faster and
more powerful QTextEdit widget that also deals with different colors
and fonts in a way similar to the existing QTextView.

<p>Qt follows the respective GUI style guides even more closely.  This
includes honoring desktop settings, and keyboard shortcuts such as
Ctrl-Z/Y for undo/redo in line edit and multi-line edit controls.
Dialog handling for both modal and non-modal dialogs has been improved
to follow the platform conventions precisely.

<p>With QIconView, we added a powerful new visualization widget similar
to QListView and QListBox.  It contains optinally labelled pixmap
items that the user can select, drag around, rename, delete and more.

<p>Compared to the previous release, we have managed to reduce overall
memory consumption while improving execution speed and features.

\title How-To Report A Bug

<p>If you think you have found a bug in Qt, we would like to hear
about it so we can fix it.

<p>Before reporting a bug, please check the
<a class="r" href="http://www.trolltech.com/faq/">FAQs</a> and
<a class="r" href="http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/">Platform Notes</a>
on our web site to see if the issue is already known.

<p>Always include the following information in your bug report:
<nl>
<li>The name and version number of your compiler
<li>The name and version number of your operating system
<li>The version of Qt you are using, and what configure options it was
compiled with.
</nl>

<p>If the problem you are reporting is only visible run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run.  Often,
such a program can be made by simply doing some minor changes to one
of the many example programs in the <tt>qt/examples</tt> directory.

<p>Please send the bug report to
<a href="mailto:qt-bugs@trolltech.com">qt-bugs@trolltech.com</a>.

 The Qt Free Edition and the Qt/Embedded Free Edition are available

<pre>
 You may use, distribute and copy the Qt GUI Toolkit under the terms of
 GNU General Public License version 2, which is displayed below.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

<center><h1>Congratulations!<br>
You've found our oldest easter egg</h1><br clear="all">

<p>A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery hierarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a N*tscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
N*tscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to

\title Books about GUI

<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.

<p><b>Programming with Qt</b> by Kalle Dalheimer, ISBN 1-56592-588-2
is a simple introduction to programming with Qt.  For those wanting
something more than our short tutorial, this is it.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565925882/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>The Design of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.

(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.

<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.

book explains these goals from scratch and how to reach them, both
with single icons and icon families.  Some 500 examples are scattered

<h3>Status of this Memo</h3>

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

   This memo documents the fundamental truths of networking for the
   Internet community. This memo does not specify a standard, except in
   the sense that all standards must implicitly follow the fundamental
   truths.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

   The truths described in this memo result from extensive study over an
   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not intend
   to contribute to this work. The editor merely has collected these
   truths, and would like to thank the networking community for
   originally illuminating these truths.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   fundamental truths underlying all networking. These truths apply to
   networking in general, and are not limited to TCP/IP, the Internet,
   or any other subset of the networking community.

<h3>2. The Fundamental Truths</h3>

   <ol>
   <li> It Has To Work.

   <li> No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
        you can't increase the speed of light.

	<ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you
	can't make a baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed
	this up <em>might</em> make it slower, but it won't make it
	happen any quicker. </ol>

   <li> With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
        as they fly overhead.

   <li> Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.

   <li> It is always possible to agglutinate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.

   <li> It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
        the problem to a different part of the overall network
        architecture) than it is to solve it.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). It is always possible to add
        another level of indirection. </ol>

   <li> It is always something.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two
        (you can't have all three). </ol>

   <li> It is more complicated than you think.

   <li> For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.

       <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary) Every networking problem always
       takes longer to solve than it seems like it should.</ol>

   <li> One size never fits all.

   <li> Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
        a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). See rule 6a. </ol>

   <li> In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
        away.

   </ol>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

   This RFC raises no security issues. However, security protocols are
   subject to the fundamental networking truths.

<h3>References</h3>

   The references have been deleted in order to protect the guilty and
   avoid enriching the lawyers.

\title Window Geometry

<h2> Overview</h2>

QWidget provides several functions that deal with a widget's
geometry.  Some of these functions operate on the pure client area
(i.e. the window excluding the window frame), others include the
window frame. The differentiation is done in a way that covers the
most common usage transparently.

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Including the window frame:</strong>
  <dd>x(), y(), frameGeometry(), pos() and move()
  <dt><strong>Excluding the window frame:</strong>
  <dd> geometry(), width(), height(), rect() and size()
</dl>

Note that the distinction only matters for decorated top-level
widgets. For all child widgets, the frame geometry is equal to the
widget's client geometry.

<h2> Unix/X11 peculiarities </h2>

On Unix/X11, a window does not have a frame until the window manager
decorates it. This happens asynchronously at some point in time after
calling show() and the first paint event the window receives - or it
does not happen at all. Keep in mind that X11 is policy-free (others
call it flexible). Thus you cannot make any safe assumption about the
decoration frame your window will get. Basic rule: There's always one
user who uses a window manager that breaks your assumption, and who
will complain to you.

Furthermore, a toolkit cannot simply place windows on the screen. All
Qt can do is to send certain hints to the window manager. The window
manager, a separate process, may either obey, ignore or misunderstand
them. Due to the partially unclear Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual (ICCCM), window placement is handled quite
differently in existing window managers.

X11 provides no standard or easy way to get the frame geometry once
the window got decorated. Qt solves this problem with nifty heuristics
and clever code that works on a wide range of window managers that
exist today. Don't be surprised if you find one where frameGeometry()
returns bogus results, though.

X11 also does not provide a way to maximize a window. The
showMaximized() function in Qt therefore has to emulate the
feature. Its result depends totally on the result of frameGeometry()
and the capability of the window manager to do proper window
placement, both of which cannot be guaranteed.

<h2>Restoring a Window's Geometry</h2>

A common task in modern applications is to restore a window's geometry
in a later session. On Windows, this is basically storing the result
of geometry() and calling setGeometry() in the next session before
doing show(). On X11, this won't work because an invisible window
doesn't have a frame yet. The window manager would decorate the window
later. When this happens, the window shifts towards the bottom/right
corner of the screen depending on the size of the decoration frame. X
theoretically provides a way to avoid this shift. Our tests have
shown, though, that almost all window managers fail to implement this
feature.

 A workaround is to call setGeometry() after show(). This has the
 two disadvantages that the widget appears at a wrong place for a
 millisecond (results in flashing) and that currently only every
 second window manager gets it right. A safer solution is to store
 both pos() and size() and to restore the geometry using resize() and
 move() before calling show(), as demonstrated in the following
 example:

\code
	MyWidget* widget = new MyWidget
	...
	QPoint p = widget->pos();	// store position
	QSize s = widget->size();	// store size
	...
	widget = new MyWidget;
	widget->resize( s ); 	// restore size
	widget->move( p ); 	// restore position
	widget->show();		// show widget
\endcode

This method works on both MS-Windows and most existing X11 window
managers.
