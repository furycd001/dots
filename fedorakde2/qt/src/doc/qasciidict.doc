  \class QAsciiDict qasciidict.h
  \brief The QAsciiDict class is a template class that provides a dictionary based on \c char* keys.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  QAsciiDict is implemented as a template class. Define a template instance
  QAsciiDict\<X\> to create a dictionary that operates on pointers to X, or X*.

  A dictionary is a collection that associates an item with a key.
  The key is used for inserting and looking up an item.  QAsciiDict has
  \c char* keys.  QAsciiDict cannot handle Unicode keys, instead use the
  QDict template which uses \l QString keys.  A QDict has the same performace
  as a QAsciiDict.

  The dictionary has very fast insertion and lookup.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qdict.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()
    {
      // Creates a dictionary that maps char* ==> char* (case insensitive)
	QAsciiDict<char> dict( 17, FALSE );

	dict.insert( "France", "Paris" );
	dict.insert( "Russia", "Moscow" );
	dict.insert( "Norway", "Oslo" );

	printf( "%s\n", dict["Norway"] );
	printf( "%s\n", dict["FRANCE"] );
	printf( "%s\n", dict["russia"] );

	if ( !dict["Italy"] )
	    printf( "Italy not defined\n" );
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Oslo
	Paris
	Moscow
	Italy not defined
  \endcode

  The dictionary in our example maps \c char* keys to \c char* items.
  Note that the mapping is case insensitive (specified in the
  \link QAsciiDict::QAsciiDict() constructor\endlink).
  QAsciiDict implements the \link operator[] [] operator\endlink to lookup an item.

  QAsciiDict is implemented by QGDict as a hash array with a fixed number of
  entries. Each array entry points to a singly linked list of buckets, in
  which the dictionary items are stored.

  When an item is inserted with a key, the key is converted (hashed) to
  an integer index into the hash array. The item is inserted before the
  first bucket in the list of buckets.

  Looking up an item is normally very fast. The key is again hashed to an
  array index. Then QAsciiDict scans the list of buckets and returns the item
  found or null if the item was not found.  You cannot insert null pointers
  into a dictionary.

  The size of the hash array is very important. In order to get good
  performance, you should use a suitably large \link primes.html prime
  number\endlink.  Suitable means equal to or larger than the maximum
  expected number of dictionary items.

  Items with equal keys are allowed.  When inserting two items with the
  same key, only the last inserted item will be visible (last in, first out)
  until it is removed.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qdict.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()
    {
      // Creates a dictionary that maps char* ==> char* (case sensitive)
	QAsciiDict<char> dict;

	dict.insert( "Germany", "Berlin" );
	dict.insert( "Germany", "Bonn" );

	printf( "%s\n", dict["Germany"] );
	dict.remove( "Germany" );	// Oct 3rd 1990
	printf( "%s\n", dict["Germany"] );
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Bonn
	Berlin
  \endcode

  The QAsciiDictIterator class can traverse the dictionary contents, but only
  in an arbitrary order.  Multiple iterators may independently traverse the
  same dictionary.

  Calling setAutoDelete(TRUE) for a dictionary tells it to delete items
  that are removed .  The default is to not delete items when they are
  removed.

  When inserting an item into a dictionary, only the pointer is copied, not
  the item itself. This is called a shallow copy. It is possible to make the
  dictionary copy all of the item's data (known as a deep copy) when an
  item is inserted.  insert() calls the virtual function
  QCollection::newItem() for the item to be inserted.
  Inherit a dictionary and reimplement it if you want deep copies.

  When removing a dictionary item, the virtual function
  QCollection::deleteItem() is called.  QAsciiDict's default implementation
  is to delete the item if auto-deletion is enabled.

/*!
  \fn QAsciiDict::QAsciiDict( int size, bool caseSensitive, bool copyKeys )
  Constructs a dictionary with the following properties:
  \arg \e size is the size of the internal hash array.
  \arg \e caseSensitive specifies whether to use case sensitive lookup or not.
  \arg \e copyKeys specifies whether to copy the key strings.

  Setting \e size to a suitably large \link primes.html prime
  number\endlink (equal to or greater than the expected number of entries)
  makes the hash distribution better and hence the loopup faster.

  Setting \e caseSensitive to TRUE will treat "abc" and "Abc" as different
  keys.  Setting it to FALSE will make the dictionary ignore case.
  Case insensitive comparison includes only the 26 standard letters A..Z,
  not French or German accents or Scandinavian letters.

  Setting \e copyKeys to TRUE will make the dictionary copy the key
  when an item is inserted.  Setting it to FALSE will make the dictionary
  only use the pointer to the key.

  Replaces an item which has a key equal to \e key with \e item.

  Null items are not allowed.

  Equivalent to:

  Removes the item associated with \e key from the dictionary.
