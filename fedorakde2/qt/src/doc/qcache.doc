  \class QCache qcache.h

  \brief The QCache class is a template class that provides a cache based on \c QString keys.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  A cache is a least recently used (LRU) list of cache items.  Each
  cache item has a key and a certain cost. The sum of item costs,
  totalCost(), never exceeds the maximum cache cost, maxCost(). If
  inserting a new item would cause the total cost to exceed the
  maximum cost, the least recently used items in the cache are
  removed.

  QCache is a template class. QCache\<X\> defines a cache that
  operates on pointers to X, or X*.

  Apart from insert(), by far the most important function is find()
  (which also exists as operator[]()).  This function looks up an item,
  returns it, and by default marks it as being the most recently used
  item.

  There are also methods to remove() or take() an object from the
  cache.  Calling setAutoDelete(TRUE) for a cache tells it to delete
  items that are removed.  The default is to not delete items when
  then are removed (i.e. remove() and take() are equivalent).

  When inserting an item into the cache, only the pointer is copied, not
  the item itself. This is called a shallow copy. It is possible to make the
  dictionary copy all of the item's data (known as a deep copy) when an
  item is inserted.  insert() calls the virtual function
  QCollection::newItem() for the item to be inserted.
  Inherit a dictionary and reimplement it if you want deep copies.

  When removing a cache item, the virtual function
  QCollection::deleteItem() is called.  The default implementation
  deletes the item if auto-deletion is enabled, and does nothing
  otherwise.

  There is a QCacheIterator which may be used to traverse the
  items in the cache in arbitrary order.

  In QCache, the cache items are accessed via \l QString keys, which
  are Unicode strings.  If you want to use non-Unicode, plain 8-bit \c
  char* keys, use the QAsciiCache template.  A QCache has the same
  performace as a QAsciiCache.

/*!
  \fn QCache::QCache( int maxCost, int size, bool caseSensitive )

  Constructs a cache with the following properties:
  \arg \a maxCost is the maximum allowed total cost.
  \arg \a size is the size of the internal hash array.
  \arg \a caseSensitive specifies whether to use case sensitive lookup or not.

  Each inserted item is associated with a cost.  When inserting a new
  item, if the total cost of all items in the cache will exceeds
  \a maxCost, the cache will start throwing out the older (recently least
  used)  items until there is room enough for the new item to be inserted.

  Setting \a size to a suitably large \link primes.html prime
  number\endlink (equal to or greater than the expected number of entries)
  makes the hash distribution better and hence the loopup faster.

  Setting \a caseSensitive to TRUE will treat "abc" and "Abc" as different
  keys.  Setting it to FALSE will make the dictionary ignore case.
  Case insensitive comparison includes the whole Unicode alphabeth.

  Returns the size of the hash array used to implement the cache.
  This should be a bit bigger than count() is likely to be.
*/

/*!

  Returns TRUE if the cache is empty, or FALSE if there is at least one
  object in it.
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QCache::insert( const QString &k, const type *d, int c, int p )

  Inserts the item \a d into the cache with key \a k and cost \a
  c. Returns TRUE if it is successful and FALSE if it fails.

  The cache's size is limited, and if the total cost is too high,
  QCache will remove old, least-used items until there is room for this
  new item.

  The parameter \a p is internal and should be left at the default
  value (0).

  \warning If this function returns FALSE, you must delete \a d
  yourself.  Additionally, be very careful about using \a d after
  calling this function, as any other insertions into the cache, from
  anywhere in the application, or within Qt itself, could cause the
  object to be discarded from the cache, and the pointer to become
  invalid.
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QCache::remove( const QString &k )

  Removes the item associated with \e k, and returns TRUE if the item
  was present in the cache or FALSE if it was not.

  The item is deleted if auto-deletion has been enabled, i.e. you have
  called setAutoDelete(TRUE).

  If there are two or more items with equal keys, then the one that
  was inserted last is is removed.

  All iterators that refer to the removed item are set to point to the
  next item in the cache's traversal order.

/*!
  \fn type *QCache::take( const QString &k )

  Takes the item associated with \e k out of the cache without
  deleting it, and returns a pointer to the item taken out, or null if
  the key does not exist in the cache.

  If there are two or more items with equal keys, then the one that
  was inserted last is taken.

  All iterators that refer to the taken item are set to point to the
  next item in the cache's traversal order.

  Removes all items from the cache, and deletes them if auto-deletion
  has been enabled.

  \fn type *QCache::find( const QString &k, bool ref ) const

  Returns the item associated with \a k, or null if the key does not
  exist in the cache.  If \a ref is TRUE (the default), the item is
  moved to the front of the LRU list.

  If there are two or more items with equal keys, then the one that
  was inserted last is returned.
*/

/*!
  \fn type *QCache::operator[]( const QString &k ) const

  Returns the item associated with \a k, or null if \a k does not
  exist in the cache, and moves the item to the front of the LRU list.

  If there are two or more items with equal keys, then the one that
  was inserted last is returned.

  This is the same as find( k, TRUE ).

  \sa find()

  \fn void QCache::statistics() const

  A debug-only utility function. Prints out cache usage, hit/miss, and
  distribution information using qDebug(). This function does nothing
  in the release library.

  \class QCacheIterator qcache.h
  \brief The QCacheIterator class provides an iterator for QCache collections.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  Note that the traversal order is arbitrary, you are not guaranteed
  any particular order.  If new objects are inserted into the cache
  while the iterator is active, the iterator may or may not see them.

  Multiple iterators are completely independent, even when they
  operate on the same QCache. QCache updates all iterators that refer
  an item when that item is removed.

  QCacheIterator provides an operator++(), and an operator+=() to
  traverse the cache, current() and currentKey() to access the current
  cache item and its key, atFirst() and atLast() which return TRUE if
  the iterator points to the first/last item in the cache, isEmpty()
  which returns TRUE if the cache is empty and finally count() which
  returns the number of items in the cache.

  Note that atFirst() and atLast() refer to the iterator's arbitrary
  ordering, not to the cache's internal LRU list.
