  \class QSortedList qsortedlist.h
  \brief The QSortedList class provides a list sorted by operator< and operator==

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  If you want to sort a QList you have to reimplement the
  QGList::compareItems() method.  If the elements of your list support
  operator<() and operator==() then you can use QSortedList instead.
  Its compareItems() calls operator<() and operator==() and returns an
  appropriate result.

  Otherwise, this is as QList.

/*!
  \fn QSortedList::QSortedList()
  Constructs an empty list.
*/

/*!
  \fn QSortedList::QSortedList( const QSortedList<type> &list )
  Constructs a copy of \e list.

  Each item in \e list is copied to this new list.
*/

/*!
  \fn QSortedList::~QSortedList()
  Removes all items from the list and destroys the list.

  All list iterators that access this list will be reset.
*/

/*!
  \fn QSortedList<type>& QSortedList::operator=(const QSortedList<type>& list)
  Assigns \e list to this list and returns a reference to this list.

  This list is first cleared, then each item in \e list is
  appended to this list.  Only the pointers are copied
  (shallow copy), unless newItem() has been reimplemented().
*/

/*!
   \fn int QSortedList::compareItems( QCollection::Item s1, QCollection::Item s2 )

   \reimp

   This reimplementation uses operator< and operator== to compare.
