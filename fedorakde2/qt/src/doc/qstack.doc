  \class QStack qstack.h
  \brief The QStack class is a template class that provides a stack.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  QStack is implemented as a template class. Define a template
  instance QStack\<X\> to create a stack that operates on pointers to
  X, or X*.

  A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure. Items are added to
  the top of the stack with push() and retrieved from the top
  with pop().

  \sa \link collection.html Collection Classes\endlink
*/

/*! \fn QStack::QStack () 
  Creates and empty stack.
*/

/*! \fn QStack::QStack (const QStack<type>& s) 
  Creates a stack by making a shallow copy of another stack.
*/

/*! \fn QStack::~QStack () 
  Destroys the stack.  All items will be deleted if autoDelete() is TRUE.
*/

/*! \fn QStack<type>& QStack::operator= (const QStack<type>& s) 
  Sets the contents of this stack by making a shallow copy of another stack.
  Elements currently in this stack will be deleted if autoDelete() is TRUE.
*/

/*! \fn bool QStack::isEmpty () const 
  Returns TRUE is the stack contains no elements to be \link pop() popped\endlink.
*/

/*! \fn void QStack::push (const type* d) 
  Adds an element to the top of the stack.  Last in, first out.
*/

/*! \fn type* QStack::pop () 
  Removes the top item from the stack and returns it.
*/

/*! \fn bool QStack::remove () 
  Removes the top item from the stack and deletes it if
  autoDelete() is TRUE.  Returns TRUE if there was an item to pop.

  \sa clear()
*/

/*! \fn void QStack::clear()
  Removes all items from the stack, deleting them if
  autoDelete() is TRUE.

  \sa remove()
*/

/*! \fn uint QStack::count() const
  Returns the number of items in the stack.

  \sa isEmpty()
*/

/*! \fn type* QStack::top () const 
  Returns a reference to the top item on the stack (most recently pushed).
  The stack is not changed.
*/

/*! \fn QStack::operator type* ()const 
  Returns a reference to the top item on the stack (most recently pushed).
  The stack is not changed.

/*! \fn type* QStack::current () const 
  Returns a reference to the top item on the stack (most recently pushed).
  The stack is not changed.

  The same as QCollection::autoDelete().
