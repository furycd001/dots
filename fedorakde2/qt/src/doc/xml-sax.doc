\title The Qt SAX2 implementation

<h2><a name="introSAX2">Introduction to SAX2</a></h2>

The SAX2 interface is an event-driven mechanism to provide the user with
document information. "Event" in this context has nothing to do with the
term "event" you probably know from windowing systems; it means that the
parser reports certain document information while parsing the document.
These reported information is referred to as "event".

To make it less abstract consider the following example:
\code 
<quote>To make it less abstract consider the following example:</quote>
\endcode

Whilst reading (a SAX2 parser is usually referred to as "reader") 
the above document three events would be triggered:
<OL>
<LI> A start tag occurs (<tt>&lt;quote&gt;</tt>).
<LI> Character data (i.e. text) is found.
<LI> An end tag is parsed (<tt>&lt;/quote&gt;</tt>).
</OL>

Each time such an event occurs the parser reports it so that 
a suitable event handling routine can be invoked.

Whilst this is a fast and simple approach to read XML documents
manipulation is difficult because data are not stored, simply handled
and discarded serially. This is when the \link xml-dom.html DOM interface 
\endlink comes handy.

The Qt XML module provides an
abstract class, \l QXmlReader, that defines the interface for potential 
SAX2 readers.
At the moment Qt ships with one reader implementation, \l
QXmlSimpleReader.

The reader reports parsing events through special handler classes. In Qt
the following ones are available:
<ul>
<li>\l QXmlContentHandler
    reports events related to the content of a document (e.g. the start tag
    or characters).
<li>\l QXmlDTDHandler
    reports events related to the DTD (e.g. notation declarations).
<li>\l QXmlErrorHandler
    reports errors or warnings that occurred during parsing.
<li>\l QXmlEntityResolver
    reports external entities during parsing and allows the user to resolve
    external entities him- or herself instead of leaving it to the reader.
<li>\l QXmlDeclHandler
    reports further DTD related events (e.g. attribute declarations).
    Usually users are not interested in them, but under certain circumstances
    this class comes handy.
<li>\l QXmlLexicalHandler
    reports events related to the lexical structure of the document
    (the beginning of the DTD, comments etc.). Occasionally this
    might be useful.
</ul>

These classes are abstract classes describing the interface. The
\l QXmlDefaultHandler class provides a "do nothing" default implementation for
all of them. Therefore users need to overload only the
QXmlDefaultHandler functions they are interested in. 

To read input XML data a special class \l QXmlInputSource is used.

Apart from the already mentioned ones the following SAX2 support classes 
provide the user with useful functionality:
<ul>
<li> \l QXmlAttributes
     is used to pass attributes in a start element event.
<li> \l QXmlLocator
     is used to obtain the actual parsing position of an event.
<li> \l QXmlNamespaceSupport
     is used to easily implement <a href="xml.html#namespaces">namespace</a>
     support for a reader.
     Note that namespaces do not change the parsing 
     behavior. They are only reported through the handler.
</ul>


<h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>
 
The behaviour of an XML reader depends on whether it supports certain
optional features or not. 
As an example a reader can have the feature 
"report attributes used for <a href="xml.html#namespaces">namespace</a>  declarations
and prefixes along with the local name of a tag".  
Like every other feature this has a unique name represented by a URI:
it is called \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes.

The Qt SAX2 implementation allows you to find out whether the 
reader has this ability using \l QXmlReader::hasFeature().
If the return value is TRUE it is possible to
turn the relevant feature on and off.
To do this use \l QXmlReader::setFeature(). Whether a supported feature
is on or off (TRUE or FALSE) can be queried using  \l QXmlReader::feature().

Consider the example 
\code 
<document xmlns:book = 'http://trolltech.com/fnord/book/'
          xmlns      = 'http://trolltech.com/fnord/' >
\endcode
A reader not supporting the
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes feature would clearly
report the element name \e document but not its attributes \e xmlns:book and \e xmlns
with their values. A
reader with the feature \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes
reports the namespace attributes if \l QXmlReader::feature() is TRUE and 
disregards them if the feature is FALSE.


Other features include \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace (namespace 
processing, implies \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes) or
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/validation (the ability to report validation
errors). 

Whilst SAX2 leaves it to the user to define and implement whatever
features are required, support for \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace
(and thus \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes) is
mandantory. Accordingly \l QXmlSimpleReader, the implementation
of \l QXmlReader that comes with the Qt XML module, supports both of them,
and therefore can do namespace processing.

Being a non-validating parser \l QXmlSimpleReader 
does not support \e http://xml.org/sax/features/validation
and other features.


<h2><a name="namespaces">Namespace support via features</a></h2>

As we have seen in the \link #features previous section \endlink
we can configure the behavior of the reader when it comes to namespace
processing. This is done by setting and unsetting the 
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes features.
 
They influence the reporting behavior in the following way:
<ol>
<li>Namespace prefixes and local parts of elements and attributes can be
    reported.
<li>The qualified names of elements and attributes are reported.
<li>\l QXmlContentHandler::startPrefixMapping() and \l 
QXmlContentHandler::endPrefixMapping() 
    are called by the reader.
<li>Attributes that declare namespaces (i.e. the attribute \e xmlns and
    attributes starting with \e xmlns: ) are reported.
</ol>

Consider the following element:

\code
<author xmlns:fnord = 'http://trolltech.com/fnord/'
             title="Ms" 
             fnord:title="Goddess" 
             name="Eris Kallisti"/>
\endcode

With \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes set to TRUE 
the reader will report four attributes, with the \e namespace-prefixes
feature set to FALSE only three: The \e xmlns:fnord attribute defining
a namespace is then "unvisible" for the reader.

The \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces feature on the other hand 
is responsible for reporting local names, namespace prefixes and -URIs.
With \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces set to TRUE
the parser will report \e title as the local name of \e fnord:title
attribute, \e fnord being the namespace prefix and \e http://trolltech.com/fnord/
as the namespace URI.
When \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces is FALSE none of them are
reported.

In the current implementation the Qt XML classes follow the definition
that the prefix \e xmlns itself isn't associated with any namespace at all
(see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/#ns-using"> 
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/#ns-using</a>).
Therefore even with \e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes both set to TRUE
the reader won't return either a local name, a namespace prefix or
a namespace URI for \e  xmlns:fnord.

This might be changed in the future following the W3C suggestion
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/">http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</a> 
to associate \e xmlns with the namespace \e http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns. 


As the SAX2 standard suggests \l QXmlSimpleReader by default has
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces set to TRUE and
\e http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes set to FALSE.
When changing this behavior using \l QXmlSimpleReader::setFeature() 
note that the combination of both features set to
FALSE is illegal.

For a practical demonstration of how the two features affect the 
output of the reader run the 
<a href="xml-tagreader-with-features-tagreader-cpp.html">tagreader with features example</a>.

<h3><a name="sax2namespaces">Summary</a></h3>

\l QXmlSimpleReader implements the following behavior (the value in 
parentheses denotes to the SAX2 requirements if they differ from the
Qt implementation:
<table border="1">
<tr>
    <th>namespaces</th>
    <th>namespace-prefixes</th>
    <th>Namespace prefix and local part</th>
    <th>Qualified names</th>
    <th>Prefix mapping</th>
    <th>xmlns attributes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TRUE</td>
    <td>FALSE</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes <font color="#808080">(Unknown)</font></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TRUE</td>
    <td>TRUE</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>

    <td>TRUE</td>
    <td>No <font color="#808080">(Unknown)</font></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No <font color="#808080">(Unknown)</font></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>FALSE</td>
    <td>FALSE</td>
    <td colspan=4 align=center><font color="#808080">(Illegal)</font></td>
</table>
 


<h2><a name="properties">Properties</a></h2>   

Properties are a more general concept. They also have a unique name,
represented as an URI, but their value is \c void*. Thus nearly everything
can be used as a property value. This concept involves some danger,
though: there are no means to ensure type-safety; the user must take care
that he or she passes the correct type. Properties are useful if a reader supports
special handler classes.

<!-- example! -->
 
The URIs used for features and properties often look like URLs, e.g. 
\c http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace. This does not mean that whatsoever
data is required at this address. It is simply a way to define unique names.
 
Everybody can define and use new SAX2 properties for his or her
readers. Property support is however not
required.
 
To set or query properties the following functions are provided:
\l QXmlReader::setProperty(), \l QXmlReader::property() and \l
QXmlReader::hasProperty().
