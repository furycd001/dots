  \class QDropSite qdropsite.h
  \brief Provides nothing and does nothing.

  This class exists only so that old code will not break.  It does
  nothing.  If your code uses it, you can safely delete it.

  It was used in Qt 1.x to do some drag and drop; that has since been
  folded into QWidget.

  For detailed information about drag-and-drop, see the QDragObject class.

  \sa QDragObject, QTextDrag, QImageDrag

/*!
  Constructs a QDropSite to handle events for the widget \a self.

  Pass <tt>this</tt> as the \a parent parameter.
  This enables dropping by calling QWidget::setAcceptDrops(TRUE).
