  \class QEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QEvent class is base class of all
  event classes. Event objects contain event parameters.

  \ingroup environment
  \ingroup event

  The   main event loop of Qt (QApplication::exec()) fetches
  native window system events from the event queue, translates them
  into QEvent and sends the translated events to QObjects.

  Generally, events come from the underlying window system, but it is
  also possible to manually send events through the QApplication class
  using QApplication::sendEvent() and QApplication::postEvent().

  QObject received events by having its QObject::event() function
  called. The function can be reimplemented in subclasses to customize
  event handling and add additional event types. QWidget::event() is
  a notable example. By default, events are dispatched to event handlers
  like QObject::timerEvent() and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent().
  QObject::installEventFilter() allows an object to intercept events
  to another object.

  The basic QEvent only contains an event type parameter.  Subclasses
  of QEvent contain additional parameters that describe the particular
  event.

  \class QTimerEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QTimerEvent class contains parameters that describe a
  timer event.

  \ingroup event

  Timer events are sent at regular intervals to objects that have
  started one or more timers.  Each timer has a unique identifier.
  A timer is started with  QObject::startTimer().

  The QTimer class provides a high-level programming interface that
  uses signals instead of events. It also provides one-shot timers.

  The event handler QObject::timerEvent() receives timer events.

/*!
  \class QMouseEvent qevent.h

  \brief The QMouseEvent class contains parameters that describe a mouse event.

  \ingroup event

  Mouse events occur when a mouse button is pressed or released inside a
  widget, or when the mouse cursor is moved.

  Mouse move events will only occur when some mouse button is pressed
  down, unless mouse tracking has been enabled with
  QWidget::setMouseTracking().

  Qt automatically grabs the mouse when a mouse button is pressed inside a
  widget, and the widget will continue to receive mouse events until the
  last mouse button is released.

  The functions pos(), x() and y() give the cursor position relative
  to the widget that receives the mouse event. If you move the widget
  as a result of the mouse event, use the global position returned by
  globalPos() to avoid a shaking motion.

  The QWidget::setEnable() function can be used to enable or disable mouse
  and keyboard events for a widget.

  The event handlers QWidget::mousePressEvent(), QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent(),
  QWidget::mouseDoubleClickEvent() and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent() receive
  mouse events.

  The \a pos parameter specifies the position relative to the
  receiving widget; \a button specifies the ButtonState of the button
  that caused the event, which should be 0 if \a type is \c
  MouseMove; \a state is the ButtonState at the time of the event.

  The globalPos() is initialized to QCursor::pos(), which may not be
  appropriate. Use the other constructor to specify the global position
  explicitly.

  \ingroup event


  Wheel events occur when a mouse wheel is turned while the widget has

  wheel was rotated backward, toward the user.

  The WHEEL_DELTA constant was set to 120 by the wheel mouse vendors
  to allow building finer-resolution wheels in the future, including
  perhaps a freely-rotating wheel with no notches. The expectation is
  that such a device would send more messages per rotation, but with a

  \class QCloseEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QCloseEvent class contains parameters that describe a close event.

  \ingroup event

  Close events are sent to widgets that the user wants to close, usually
  by choosing "Close" from the window menu. They are also sent when you
  call QWidget::close() to close a widget from inside the program.

  Close events contain a special accept flag which tells whether the
  receiver wants the widget to be closed.  When a widget accepts the
  close event, it is hidden. If it refuses to accept the close event,
  either nothing happens or it is forcibly closed, if the sender of
  the close event really wants to.

  The main widget of the application - QApplication::mainWidget() - is
  a special case.  When it accepts the close event, Qt leaves the main
  event loop and the application is immediately terminated (i.e. it
  returns back from the call to QApplication::exec() in your main()
  function).

  The event handler QWidget::closeEvent() receives close events.  The
  default implementation of this event handler accepts the close
  event.  If you do not want your widget to be hidden, or want some
  special handing, you need to reimplement the event handler.

  The <a href="simple-application.html#closeEvent">closeEvent() in the
  Application Walkthrough</a> shows a close event handler that asks
  whether to save the document before closing.

  If you want your widget also to be deleted when it is closed, simply
  create it with the \c WDestructiveClose widget flag.  This is very
  useful for the independent top-level windows of a multi window
  application. The Application Walkthrough example uses this too.

  QObject emits the \link QObject::destroyed() destroyed()\endlink signal
  when it is deleted.  This is a useful signal if a widget needs to know
  when another widget is deleted.

  If the last toplevel window is closed, the
  QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted.

  Child events are sent to objects when children are inserted or removed.

  Note that if a child is removed immediately after it is inserted, the 
  \c ChildInserted event may be suppressed, but the \c ChildRemoved 
  event will always be sent. In this case there will be a \c ChildRemoved
  event without a corresponding \c ChildInserted event.

  The handler for these events is QObject::childEvent().

/*!
  \class QCustomEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QCustomEvent class provides support for custom events.

  \ingroup event

  QCustomEvent is a generic event class for user-defined events. User
  defined events can be sent to widgets or other QObject instances
  using QApplication::postEvent() or
  QApplication::sendEvent(). Subclasses of QWidget can easily receive
  custom events by implementing the QWidget::customEvent() event
  handler function.

  QCustomEvent objects should be created with a type id that uniquely
  identifies the event type. To avoid clashes with the Qt-defined
  events types, the value should be at least as large as the value of
  the "User" entry in the QEvent::Type enum.

  QCustomEvent contains a generic void* data member that may be used
  for transferring event-specific data to the receiver. Note that
  since events are normally delivered asynchronously, the data
  pointer, if used, must remain valid until the event has been
  received and processed.

  QCustomEvent can be used as-is for simple user-defined event types,
  but normally you will want to make a subclass of it for your event
  types. In a subclass, you can add data members that are suitable for
  your event type.

  Example:
  \code
  class ColorChangeEvent : public QCustomEvent
  {
  public:
    ColorChangeEvent( QColor color )
	: QCustomEvent( 346798 ), c( color ) {};
    QColor color() const { return c; };
  private:
    QColor c;
  };

  // To send an event of this custom event type:

  ColorChangeEvent* ce = new ColorChangeEvent( blue );
  QApplication::postEvent( receiver, ce );    // Qt will delete it when done

  // To receive an event of this custom event type:

  void MyWidget::customEvent( QCustomEvent * e )
  {
    if ( e->type() == 346798 ) {              // It must be a ColorChangeEvent
      ColorChangeEvent* ce = (ColorChangeEvent*)e;
      newColor = ce->color();
    }
  }
  \endcode

  \enum QDropEvent::Action

  This type describes the action which a source requests that a target
  perform with dropped data.  The values are:

  <ul>
   <li>\c Copy - the default action.  The source simply users the data
	    provided in the operation.
   <li>\c Link. The source should somehow create a link to the location
	    specified by the data.
   <li>\c Move.  The source should somehow move the object from the location
	    specified by the data to a new location.
   <li>\c Private.  The target has special knowledge of the MIME type, which
	    the source should respond to similar to a Copy.
   <li>\c UserAction.  The source and target can co-operate using special
	    actions.  This feature is not supported in Qt at this time.
