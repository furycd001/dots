// NOT REVISED
/*!
  \class QFocusData qfocusdata.h
  \brief Maintains the list of widgets which can take focus.

  This read-only list always contains at least one widget (the
  top-level widget, actually).  It provides a simple cursor, which can
  be reset to the current focus widget using home(), or moved to its
  neighboring widgets using next() and prev(), and a count() of
  widgets in the list.

  Note that some widgets in the list may not accept focus.  Widgets
  are added to the list as necessary, but not removed from it.  This
  lets widgets change focus policy dynamically without disrupting the
  focus chain the user sees: When a widget disables and re-enables tab
  focus, its position in the focus chain does not change.

  When reimplementing QWidget::focusNextPrevChild() to provide special
  focus flow, you will usually call QWidget::focusData() to retrieve
  the focus data stored at the top-level widget - the focus data for
  that hierarchy of widgets.

  The cursor may change at any time; this class is not thread-safe.
