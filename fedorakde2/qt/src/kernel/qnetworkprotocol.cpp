  \class QNetworkProtocol qnetworkprotocol.h

  \brief This is the base class for network protocols which provides
  a common API for network protocols.

  \ingroup io

  This is a baseclass which should be used for implementations
  of network protocols which can then be used in Qt (e.g.
  in the filedialog) together with the QUrlOperator.

  The easiest way to implement a new network protocol is, to
  reimplement the operation[something]( QNetworkOperation * )
  methods. Of course only the ones, which are supported, should
  be reimplemented. To specify which operations are supported,
  also reimplement supportedOperations() and return an int there,
  which is ore'd together using the supported operations from
  the QNetworkProtocol::Operation enum.

  When you implement a network protocol this way, be careful
  that you always emit the correct signals. Also, always emit
  the finished() signal when an operation is done (on failure or
  success!). The Qt Network Architecture relies on correctly emitted
  finished() signals.

  For a detailed description about the Qt Network Architecture, and
  also how to implement and use network protocols in Qt, look
  at the <a href="network.html">Qt Network Documentation</a>.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::newChildren( const QValueList<QUrlInfo> &i, QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted after listChildren() was called and
  new children (e.g. files) have been read from list of files. \a i
  holds the information about the new children.
  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation, including the state and so on.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.

  When implementing an own network protocol and reading children in most
  cases you don't read one child at once, but a list of them. That's why this signal
  takes a list of QUrlInfo objects. But if you read only one child at once, you can
  use the convenience signal newChild(), which takes only a single QUrlInfo object.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::newChild( const QUrlInfo &i, QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted if a new child has been read. QNetworkProtocol
  automatically connects that to a slot which creates a list of QUrlInfo objects
  (with just the one QUrlInfo \a i) and emits then newChildren() signal with this
  created list.

  So this is just a convenience signal when implementing an own network protocol. In all
  other cases just care about the newChildren() signal with the list of QUrlInfo objects.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::finished( QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted when an operation of some sort finished.
  This signal is emitted always, this means on success and on failure.
  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation which has been finished, including the state and so on.
  To check if the operation was successful or not, check the state and
  error code of the operation object.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::start( QNetworkOperation *op )

  Some operations (like listChildren()) emit this signal
  when they start processing the operation.
  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation, including the state and so on.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::createdDirectory( const QUrlInfo &i, QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted when mkdir() has been succesful
  and the directory has been created. \a i holds the information
  about the new directory.
  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation, including the state and so on and using op->arg( 0 )
  you also get the filename of the new directory.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::removed( QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted when remove() has been succesful
  and the file has been removed. \a op holds the filename
  of the removed file in the first argument, you get it
  with op->arg( 0 ).

  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation, including the state and so on.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::itemChanged( QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted whenever a file, which is a child of this URL,
  has been changed e.g. by successfully calling rename(). \a op holds
  the original and the new filenames in the first and second arguments.
  You get them with op->arg( 0 ) and op->arg( 1 ).

  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation, including the state and so on.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::data( const QByteArray &data, QNetworkOperation *op )

  This signal is emitted when new \a data has been received
  after e.g. calling get() or put(). \a op holds the name of the file which data
  is retrieved in the first argument and the data in the second argument (raw).
  You get them with op->arg( 0 ) and op->rawArg( 1 ).

  \a op is the pointer to the operation object, which contains all infos
  of the operation, including the state and so on.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::dataTransferProgress( int bytesDone, int bytesTotal, QNetworkOperation *op )

  When transferring data (using put() or get()) this signal is emitted during the progress.
  \a bytesDone tells how many bytes of \a bytesTotal are transferred. More information
  about the operation is stored in the \a op, the pointer to the network operation
  which is processed. \a bytesTotal may be -1, which means that the number of total
  bytes is not known.

  When a protocol emits this signal, QNetworkProtocol is smart enough
  to let the QUrlOperator, which is used by the network protocol, emit
  its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QNetworkProtocol::connectionStateChanged( int state, const QString &data )

  This signal is emitted whenever the state of the connection of
  the network protocol is changed. \a state describes the new state,
  which is one of
  	ConHostFound,
	ConConnected,
	ConClosed
  \a data is a message text.
*/

/*!
  \enum QNetworkProtocol::State

  This enum contains the state which a QNetworkOperation
  can have:

  <ul>
  <li> \c StWaiting - The operation is in the queue of the QNetworkProtocol
  and is waiting for being prcessed
  <li> \c StInProgress - The operation is just processed
  <li> \c StDone - The operation has been processed succesfully
  <li> \c StFailed - The operation has been processed but an error occurred
  <li> \c StStopped - The operation has been processed but has been stopped before it finished
  </ul>
*/

/*!
  \enum QNetworkProtocol::Operation

  This enum lists all possible operations which a network protocol
  can support. supportedOperations() returns an int which is or'd
  together of these values, also the type() or a QNetworkOperation
  is always one of these values.

  <ul>
  <li> \c OpListChildren - Listing the children of a URL, e.g. of a directory
  <li> \c OpMkdir - Create a directory
  <li> \c OpRemove - remove a child (e.g. file)
  <li> \c OpRename - rename a child (e.g. file )
  <li> \c OpGet - get data from a location
  <li> \c OpPut - put data to a location
  </ul>
*/

/*!
  \enum QNetworkProtocol::ConnectionState

  When the connection state of a network protocol changes, it emits
  the signal connectionStateChanged(). The first argument is one
  of following values:

  <ul>
  <li> \c ConHostFound - Host has been found
  <li> \c ConConnected - Connection to the host has been established
  <li> \c ConClosed - connection has been closed
  </ul>
*/

/*!
  \enum QNetworkProtocol::Error

  When an operation failed (finished without success) the QNetworkOperation
  of the operation returns an error code, which is one of following values:

  <ul>
  <li>\c NoError - No error occurred
  <li>\c ErrValid - The URL you are operating on is not valid
  <li>\c ErrUnknownProtocol - There is no protocol implementation available for the protocol of the URL you are operating on (e.g. if the protocol is http and no http implementation has been registered)
  <li>\c ErrUnsupported - The operation is not supported by the protocol
  <li>\c ErrParse - Parse error of the URL
  <li>\c ErrLoginIncorrect - You needed to login but the username and or password are wrong
  <li>\c ErrHostNotFound - The specified host (in the URL) couldn´t be found
  <li>\c ErrListChlidren - An error occurred while listing the children
  <li>\c ErrMkdir - An error occurred when creating a directory
  <li>\c ErrRemove - An error occurred while removing a child
  <li>\c ErrRename  - An error occurred while renaming a child
  <li>\c ErrGet - An error occurred while getting (retrieving) data
  <li>\c ErrPut - An error occurred while putting (uploading) data
  <li>\c ErrFileNotExisting - A file which is needed by the operation doesn't exist
  <li>\c ErrPermissionDenied - The permission for doing the operation has been denied
  </ul>

  When implementing custom network protocols, you should also use these
  values of error codes. If this is not possible, you can define your own ones
  by using an integer value which doesn't conflict with one of these vales.
