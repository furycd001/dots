  \class QPaintDeviceMetrics qpaintdevicemetrics.h
  \brief The QPaintDeviceMetrics class provides information about a
  paint device.

  \ingroup drawing

  Sometimes it is necessary to obtain information about the physical
  characteristics of a paint device when drawing graphics.  This class
  provides just that.  For example, to compute the aspect ratio of a
  paint device:

  \code
    QPaintDeviceMetrics pdm( myWidget );
    double aspect = (double)pdm.widthMM() / (double)pdm.heightMM();
  \endcode

  QPaintDeviceMetrics contains methods to provide the width and height
  of a device in both pixels and millimeters, the number of colors
  the device supports, the number of bit planes, and finally the
  resolution of the device.

  Note that it is not always possible for QPaintDeviceMetrics to
  compute the values you ask for, particularly for external devices.
  The ultimate example is asking for the resolution of a QPrinter
  that is set to "print to file" - who knows what printer that file
  will end up?

  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::width() const

  Returns the width of the paint device, in default coordinate system
  units (e.g. pixels for QPixmap and QWidget).
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::height() const

  Returns the height of the paint device, in default coordinate system
  units (e.g. pixels for QPixmap and QWidget).
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::widthMM() const
  Returns the width of the paint device, measured in millimeters.
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::heightMM() const
  Returns the height of the paint device, measured in millimeters.
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::numColors() const
  Returns the number of different colors available for the paint device.
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::depth() const
  Returns the bit depth (number of bit planes) of the paint device.
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::logicalDpiX() const

  Returns the horizontal resolution of the device, in dots per inch, that is
  used when computing font sizes.
  For X this is usually the same as could be computed
  from widthMM(), but on Windows this varies.
*/

/*!
  \fn int QPaintDeviceMetrics::logicalDpiY() const

  Returns the vertical resolution of the device, in dots per inch, that is
  used when computing font sizes.
  For X this is usually the same as could be computed
  from heightMM(), but on Windows this varies.
