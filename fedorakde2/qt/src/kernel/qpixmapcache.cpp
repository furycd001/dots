  \class QPixmapCache qpixmapcache.h

  \brief The QPixmapCache class provides an application-global cache for
  pixmaps.

  \ingroup environment
  \ingroup drawing

  This class is a tool for optimized drawing with QPixmap.  You can
  use it to store temporary pixmaps that are expensive to generate,
  without using more storage space than cacheLimit(). Use insert() to
  insert pixmaps, find() to find them and clear() to empty the cache.

  Here follows an example. QRadioButton has a non-trivial visual
  representation. In the function QRadioButton::drawButton(), we do
  not draw the radio button directly. Instead, we first check the
  global pixmap cache for a pixmap with the key "$qt_radio_nnn_",
  where \c nnn is a numerical value that specifies the the radio
  button state.  If a pixmap is found, we bitBlt() it onto the widget
  and return. Otherwise, we create a new pixmap, draw the radio button
  in the pixmap and finally insert the pixmap in the global pixmap
  cache, using the key above.  The bitBlt() is 10 times faster than
  drawing the radio button.  All radio buttons in the program share
  the cached pixmap since QPixmapCache is application-global.

  QPixmapCache contains no member data, only static functions to access
  the global pixmap cache.  It creates an internal QCache for caching the
  pixmaps.

  The cache associates a pixmap with a normal string (key).  If two
  pixmaps are inserted into the cache using equal keys, then the last
  pixmap will hide the first pixmap. The QDict and QCache classes do
  exactly the same.

  The cache becomes full when the total size of all pixmaps in the
  cache exceeds cacheLimit().  The initial cache limit is 1024 KByte
  (1 MByte); it is changed with setCacheLimit().  A pixmap takes
  roughly width*height*depth/8 bytes of memory.

  See the \l QCache documentation for more details about the cache mechanism.

  This is supposed to cut the cache size down by about 80-90% in a
  minute once the application becomes idle, to let any inserted pixmap
  remain in the cache for some time before it becomes a candidate for
  cleaning-up, and to not cut down the size of the cache while the
  cache is in active use.

  When the last pixmap has been deleted from the cache, kill the
  timer so Qt won't keep the CPU from going into sleep mode.

  Returns the pixmap associated with \a key in the cache, or null if there

  <strong>
    NOTE: if valid, you should copy the pixmap immediately (this is quick
    since QPixmaps are \link shclass.html implicitly shared\endlink), because
    subsequent insertions into the cache could cause the pointer to become
    invalid.  For this reason, we recommend you use
    find(const QString&, QPixmap&) instead.

  Example:
  \code
    QPixmap* pp;
    QPixmap p;

  Looks for a cached pixmap associated with \a key in the cache.  If a
  pixmap is found, the function sets \a pm to that pixmap and returns
  TRUE.  Otherwise, the function returns FALSE and does not change \a

  Example:
  \code
    QPixmap p;
    if ( !QPixmapCache::find("my_previous_copy", pm) ) {
	pm.load("bigimage.png");
	QPixmapCache::insert("my_previous_copy", pm);

  \obsolete
  Inserts the pixmap \a pm associated with \a key into the cache.
  Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE if the pixmap is too big for the cache.

  <strong>
    NOTE: \a pm must be allocated on the heap (using \c new).

    If this function returns FALSE, you must delete \a pm yourself.

    If this function returns TRUE, do not use \a pm afterwards or
    keep references to it, as any other insertions into the cache,
    from anywhere in the application, or within Qt itself, could cause
    the pixmap to be discarded from the cache, and the pointer to
    become invalid.

    Due to these dangers, we strongly recommend that you use
    insert(const QString&, const QPixmap&) instead.
