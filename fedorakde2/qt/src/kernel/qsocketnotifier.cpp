  \class QSocketNotifier qsocketnotifier.h
  \brief The QSocketNotifer class provides support for socket callbacks.

  \ingroup io

  This class makes it possible to write e.g. asynchronous TCP/IP
  socket-based code in Qt.  Using synchronous socket operations blocks
  the program, which is clearly not acceptable for an event-based GUI
  program.

  Once you have opened a non-blocking socket (either for TCP, UDP, a
  unix-domain socket, or any other protocol family your operating
  system supports), you can create a socket notifier to monitor the
  socket.  Then connect the activated() signal to the slot you want to
  be called when a socket event occurs.

  There are three types of socket notifiers (read, write and exception)
  and you must specify one of these in the constructor.

  The type specifies when the activated() signal is to be emitted:
  <ol>
  <li> \c QSocketNotifier::Read: There is data to be read (socket read event).
  <li> \c QSocketNotifier::Write: Data can be written (socket write event).
  <li> \c QSocketNofifier::Exception: An exception has occurred (socket
  exception event).  We recommend against using this.
  </ol>

  For example, if you need to monitor both reads and writes for the same
  socket, you must create two socket notifiers.

  Example:
  \code
    int sockfd;					// socket identifier
    struct sockaddr_in sa;			// should contain host address
    sockfd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 ); // create TCP socket
    // make the socket non-blocking here, usually using fcntl( O_NONBLOCK )
    ::connect( sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&sa,	// connect to host
	       sizeof(sa) );			//   NOT QObject::connect()!
    QSocketNotifier *sn;
    sn = new QSocketNotifier( sockfd, QSocketNotifier::Read, parent );
    QObject::connect( sn, SIGNAL(activated(int)),
		      myObject, SLOT(dataReceived()) );
  \endcode

  The optional \a parent argument can be set to make the socket notifier a
  child of some widget and therefore be automatically destroyed when the
  widget is destroyed.

  For read notifiers, it makes little sense to connect the activated()
  signal to more than one slot, because the data can be read from the
  socket only once.

  Also observe that if you do not read all the available data when the
  read notifier fires, it fires again and again.

  If you disable the read notifier, your program may deadlock.	Avoid
  it if you do not know what you are doing.  (The same applies to
  exception notifiers if you have to use that, for instance if you \e
  have to use TCP urgent data.)

  For write notifiers, after the activated() signal has been received
  and you have sent the data to be written on the socket, immediately
  disable the notifier. When you have more data to be written, enable
  it again to get a new activated() signal. The exception is if the
  socket data writing operation (send() or equivalent) fails with a
  "Would block" error, meaning that some buffer is full and you must
  wait before sending more data. In this case, you do not need to
  disable and re-enable the write notifier, it will fire again as soon
  as the system allows more data may be sent.

  The behaviour of a write notifier that is left in enabled state
  after having emitting the first activated() signal (and no "would
  block" error has occurred) is undefined. Depending on the operating
  system, it may fire on every pass of the event loop, or not at all.

  If you need a time-out for your sockets, you can use either
  \link QObject::startTimer() timer events\endlink or the QTimer class.

  Socket action is detected in the \link QApplication::exec() main event
  loop\endlink of Qt.  The X11 version of Qt has has a single UNIX
  select() call which incorporates all socket notifiers and the X socket.

  Note that on XFree86 for OS/2, select() only works in the thread in
  which main() is running, therefore you should use that thread for GUI
  operations.

/*!
  Enables the notifier if \e enable is TRUE, or disables it if \e enable is
  FALSE.

  The notifier is by default enabled.

  If the notifier is enabled, it emits the activated() signal whenever a
  socket event corresponding to its \link type() type\endlink occurs.  If
  it is disabled, it ignores socket events (the same effect as not creating
  the socket notifier).

  Write notifiers should normally be disabled immediately after the
  activated() signal has been emitted; see discussion of write
  notifiers in the class description above.
