  \brief Access to the platform audio facilities.
  
  \ingroup sound

  Qt provides the most commonly required audio operation in
  GUI applications: playing a sound file asynchronously
  to the user. This is most simply accomplished with a single call:
  \code
    QSound::play("mysounds/bells.wav");
  \endcode

  A second API is provided, where a QSound object is created
  from a sound file and is later be played:
  \code
    QSound bells("mysounds/bells.wav");

    bells.play();
  \endcode

  Sounds played by the second model may use more memory but play
  more immediately than sounds played using the first model, depending
  on the underlying platform audio facilities.

  On Microsoft Windows, the underlying multimedia system is used and
  hence WAVE format sound files are supported.

  On X11, the
  <a href=ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/nas/>Network Audio System</a>
  is used if available, otherwise all
  operations work silently. NAS supports WAVE and AU files.

  On Qt/Embedded, a built-in mixing sound server is used, which accesses
  <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> directly. Only a single WAVE format is supported,
  though that support can be configured when building Qt. The default is
  11.025 kHz 8-bit mono PCM.

  The availability of sound can be
  tested with QSound::available().
