This directory contains the source code and make files for the Qt Meta
Object Compiler (moc).

The files mocgen.cpp and lex.yy.c are generated by yacc and lex.

In order to compile the moc program from scratch, you will need yacc
(byacc on Windows) and lex.  These tools are preinstalled on most Unix
systems.

If you run Windows, you can install the Cygwin32 package
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/win32

Notice that moc does not compile with GNU bison, use standard AT&T yacc
or Berkeley yacc instead.
