This tool converts Microsoft Resource Files (*.rc) to Qt Designer
Userinterface Description Files.

First compile it by typing make, gmake or nmake, depending what your
make utility is. 

Then you can add it as filter to the Qt Designer. Open the file
.designerrc in your home directory in an editor. If this file doesn't
exist yet, start and exit the Qt Designer once.

Now you will find a part

[Import]
numFilters = 0

in that file. Replace that by

[Import]
numFilters = 1
wildcard[0] = Microsoft Resource Files (*.rc)
command[0] = rc2ui %f

If you start the Qt Designer now, you will be able to choose .rc files
in the filedialog and import them.
