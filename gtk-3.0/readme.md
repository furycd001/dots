# [ GTK-3.0 ]

This is my gtk.css for gtk 3.0. I use this to add padding to xfce4-terminal & to change font properties in xfce4-genmon-plugin. This file should already exist in **/home/user/.config/gtk-3.0**. If not create it or drop my file in place and edit as need be....

#### Xfce4-terminal with added padding.
