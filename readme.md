#### This repo mainly contains xfce4-terminal & xfwm themes, along with scripts that I use. I don't really play with conky all that much as I have it pretty much how I like it. If you use a terminal other than xfce4-terminal you can use [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) to convert the themes.
