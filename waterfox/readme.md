# [ WATERFOX USERCHROME CSS ]


This is my Waterfox userchrome.css. It's based on the ever popular [**arc theme**](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) & has been made with minimal looks in mind. There's still a few things that I need to work on, but it's pretty complete as it is now. I'll eventually complete everything, but for now I'm happy with what I have...
