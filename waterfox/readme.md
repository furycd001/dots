# [ WATERFOX USERCHROME CSS ]


This is my Waterfox userchrome.css. It's based on the ever popular [**arc theme**](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) & has been made with minimal looks in mind. There's still a few things that I need to work on, but it's pretty complete as it is now. I'll eventually complete everything, but for now I'm happy with what I have...

> PLEASE NOTE THAT FOR THIS TO WORK YOU MUST BE USING COMPACT DARK AS THE THEME IN WATERFOX. TO ENABLE CLICK ON â‰¡ AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM CHNAGE THE THEME TO BE COMPACT DARK..
